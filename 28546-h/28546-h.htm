<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>Once more I come before the public with a work on the history of a
nation which is not mine by birth.</p>

<p>It is the ambition of all nations which enjoy a literary culture to
possess a harmonious and vivid narrative of their own past history. And
it is of inestimable value to any people to obtain such a narrative,
which shall comprehend all epochs, be true to fact and, while resting on
thorough research, yet be attractive to the reader; for only by this aid
can the nation attain to a perfect self-consciousness, and feeling the
pulsation of its life throughout the story, become fully acquainted with
its own origin and growth and character. But we may doubt whether up to
this time works of such an import and compass have ever been produced,
and even whether they can be produced. For who could apply critical
research, such as the progress of study now renders necessary, to the
mass of materials already collected, without being lost in its
immensity? Who again could possess the vivid susceptibility requisite
for doing justice to the several epochs, for appreciating the actions,
the modes of thought, and the moral standard of each of them, and for
understanding their relations to universal history? We must be content
in this department, as well as in others, if we can but approximate to
the ideal we set up. The best-written histories will be accounted the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
best.</p>

<p>When then an author undertakes to make the past life of a foreign nation
the object of a comprehensive literary work, he will not think of
writing its history as a nation in detail: for a foreigner this would be
impossible: but, in accordance with the point of view he would naturally
take, he will direct his eyes to those epochs which have had the most
effectual influence on the development of mankind: only so far as is
necessary for the comprehension of these, will he introduce anything
that precedes or comes after them.</p>

<p>There is an especial charm in following, century after century, the
history of the English nation, in considering the antagonism of the
elements out of which it is composed, and its share in the fortunes and
enterprises of that great community of western nations to which it
belongs; but it will be readily granted that no other period can be
compared in general importance with the epoch of those religious and
political wars which fill the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.</p>

<p>In the sixteenth century the part which England took in the work of
emancipating the world from the rule of the western hierarchy decisively
influenced not only its own constitution, but also the success of the
religious revolution throughout Europe. In England the monarchy
perfectly understood its position in relation to this great change;
while favouring the movement in its own interest, it nevertheless
contrived to maintain the old historical state of things to a great
extent; nowhere have more of the institutions of the Middle Ages been
retained than in England; nowhere did the spiritual power link itself
more closely with the temporal. Here less depends on the conflict of
doctrines, for which Germany is the classic ground: the main interest
lies in the political transformation, accomplished amidst
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
manifold variations of opinions, tendencies, and events, and attended at last by
a war for the very existence of the nation. For it was against England
that the sacerdotal reaction directed its main attack. To withstand it,
the country was forced to ally itself with the kindred elements on the
Continent: the successful resistance of England was in turn of the
greatest service to them. The maintenance of Protestantism in Western
Europe, on the Continent as well as in Britain, was effected by the
united powers of both. To bring out clearly this alternate action, it
would not be advisable to lay weight on every temporary foreign
relation, on every step of the home administration, and to search out
men's personal motives in them; a shorter sketch may be best suited to
show the chief characters, as well as the main purport of the events in
their full light.</p>

<p>But then, through the connexion of England with Scotland, and the
accession of a new dynasty, a state of things ensued under which the
continued maintenance of the position taken up in home and foreign
politics was rendered doubtful. The question arose whether the policy of
England would not differ from that of Great Britain and be compelled to
give way to it. The attempt to decide this question, and the reciprocal
influence of the newly allied countries, brought on conflicts at home
which, though they in the main arose out of foreign relations, yet for a
long while threw those relations into the background.</p>

<p>If we were required to express in the most general terms the distinction
between English and French policy in the last two centuries, we might
say that it consisted in this, that the glory of their arms abroad lay
nearest to the heart of the French nation, and the legal settlement of
their home affairs to that of the English. How often have the French, in
appearance at least, allowed themselves to be consoled for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
defects of the home administration by a great victory or an advantageous peace!
And the English, from regard to constitutional questions of apparently
inferior importance, have not seldom turned their eyes away from
grievous perils which hung over Europe.</p>

<p>The two great constitutional powers in England, the Crown and the
Parliament, dating back as they did to early times, had often previously
contended with each other, but had harmoniously combined in the
religious struggle, and had both gained strength thereby; but towards
the middle of the seventeenth century we see them first come into
collision over ecclesiastical regulations, and then engage in a war for
life and death respecting the constitution of the realm. Elements
originally separate unite in attacking the monarchy; meanwhile the old
system breaks up, and energetic efforts are made to found a new one on
its ruins. But none of them succeed; the deeply-felt need of a life
regulated by law and able to trust its own future is not satisfied;
after long storms men seek safety in a return to the old and approved
historic forms so characteristic of the German, and especially of the
English, race. But in this there is clearly no solution of the original
controversies, no reconciliation of the conflicting elements: within
narrower limits new discords break out, which once more threaten a
complete overthrow: until, thanks to the indifference shown by England
to continental events, the most formidable dangers arise to threaten the
equilibrium of Europe, and even menace England itself. These European
emergencies coinciding with the troubles at home bring about a new
change of the old forms in the Revolution of 1688, the main result of
which is, that the centre of gravity of public authority in England
shifts decisively to the parliamentary side. It was during this same
time that France had won military and political
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
superiority over all its neighbours on the mainland, and in connexion with it had
concentrated an almost absolute power at home in the hands of the
monarchy. England thus reorganised now set itself to contest the
political superiority of France in a long and bloody war, which
consequently became a struggle between two rival forms of polity; and
while the first of these bore sway over the rest of Europe, the other
attained to complete realisation in its island-home, and called forth at
a later time manifold imitations on the Continent also, when the
Continent was torn by civil strife. Between these differing tendencies,
these opposite poles, the life of Europe has ever since vibrated from
side to side.</p>

<p>When we contemplate the framework of the earth, those heights which
testify to the inherent energy of the original and active elements
attract our special notice; we admire the massive mountains which
overhang and dominate the lowlands covered with the settlements of man.
So also in the domain of history we are attracted by epochs at which the
elemental forces, whose joint action or tempered antagonism has produced
states and kingdoms, rise in sudden war against each other, and amidst
the surging sea of troubles upheave into the light new formations, which
give to subsequent ages their special character. Such a historic region,
dominating the world, is formed by that epoch of English history, to
which the studies have been devoted, whose results I venture to publish
in the present work: its importance is as great where it directly
touches on the universal interests of humanity, as where, on its own
special ground, it develops itself apart in obedience to its inner
impulses. To comprehend this period we must approach it as closely as
possible: it is everywhere instinct with collective as well as
individual life. We discern how great antagonistic principles sprang
almost unavoidably out of earlier times, how they came into conflict,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
wherein the strength of each side lay, what caused the alternations of
success, and how the final decisions were brought about: but at the same
time we perceive how much, for themselves, for the great interests they
represented, and for the enemies they subdued, depended on the
character, the energy, the conduct of individuals. Were the men equal to
the emergency, or were not circumstances stronger than they? From the
conflict of the universal with the special it is that the great
catastrophes of history arise, yet it sometimes happens that the efforts
which seem to perish with their authors exercise a more lasting
influence on the progress of events than does the power of the
conqueror. In the agonising struggles of men's minds appear ideas and
designs which pass beyond what is feasible in that land and at that
time, perhaps even beyond what is desirable: these find a place and a
future in the colonies, the settlement of which is closely connected
with the struggle at home. We are far from intending to involve
ourselves in juridical and constitutional controversies, or from
regulating the distribution of praise and blame by the opinions which
have gained the day at a later time, or prevail at the moment; still
less shall we be guided by our own sympathies: our only concern is to
become acquainted with the great motive powers and their results. And
yet how can we help recognising manifold coincidences with that conflict
of opinions and tendencies in which we are involved at the present day?
But it is no part of our plan to follow these out. Momentary
resemblances often mislead the politician who seeks a sure foothold in
the past, as well as the historian who seeks it in the present. The Muse
of history has the widest intellectual horizon and the full courage of
her convictions; but in forming them she is thoroughly conscientious,
and we might say jealously bent on her duty. To introduce the interests
of the present time into the work
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
of the historian usually ends in restricting its free accomplishment.</p>

<p>This epoch has been already often treated of, if not as a whole, yet in
detached parts, and that by the best English historical writers. A
native author has this great advantage over foreigners, that he thinks
in the language in which the persons of the drama spoke, and lets them
be seen through no strange medium, but simply in their natural form. But
when, too, this language is employed in rare perfection, as in a work of
our own time,&mdash;I refer not merely to rounded periods and euphony of
cadence, but to the spirit of the narrative so much in harmony with our
present culture, and the tone of our minds, and to the style which by
every happy word excites our vivid sympathy;&mdash;when we have before us a
description of the events in the native language with all its attractive
traits and broad colouring, a description too based on an old familiar
acquaintance with the country and its condition: it would be folly to
pretend to rival such a work in its own peculiar sphere. But the results
of original study may lead us to form a different conception of the
events. And it is surely good that, in epochs of such great importance
for the history of all nations, we should possess foreign and
independent representations to compare with those of home growth; in the
latter are expressed sympathies and antipathies as inherited by
tradition and affected by the antagonism of literary differences of
opinion. Moreover there will be a difference between these foreign
representations. Frenchmen, as in one famous instance, will hold more to
the constitutional point of view, and look for instruction or example in
political science. The German will labour (after investigation into
original documents) to comprehend each event as a political and
religious whole, and at the same time to view it in its universal
historical relations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
I can in this case, as in others, add something new to what is already
known, and this to a larger extent as the work goes
on.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>In no nation has so much documentary matter been collected for its later
history as in England. The leading families which have taken part in
public business, and the different parties which wish to assert their
views in the historical representation of the past as well as in the
affairs of the present, have done much for this object; latterly the
government also has set its hand to the work. Yet the existing
publications are far from sufficient. How incredibly deficient our
knowledge still is of even the most important parliamentary
transactions! In the rich collections of the Record Office and of the
British Museum I have sought and found much that was unknown, and which
I needed for obtaining an insight into events. The labour spent on it is
richly compensated by the gain such labour brings; over the originals so
injured, and so hard to decipher, linger the spirits of that long-past
age. Especial attention is due to the almost complete series of
pamphlets of the time, which the Museum possesses. As we read them,
there are years in which we are present, as it were, at the public
discussion that went on, at least in the capital, from month to month,
from week to week, on the weightiest questions of government and public
life.</p>

<p>If any one has ever attempted to reconstruct for himself a portion of
the past from materials of this kind,&mdash;from original
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
documents, and party writings which, prompted by hate or personal friendship, are
intended for defence or attack, and yet are withal exceedingly
incomplete,&mdash;he will have felt the need of other contemporary notices,
going into detail but free from such party views. A rich harvest of such
independent reports has been supplied to me for this, as well as for my
other works, by the archives of the ancient Republic of Venice. The
'Relations,' which the ambassadors of that Republic were wont to draw up
on their return home, invaluable though they are in reference to persons
and the state of affairs in general, are not, however, sufficient to
supply a detailed and consecutive account of events. But the Venetian
archives possess also a long series of continuous Reports, which place
us, as it were, in the very midst of the courts, the capitals, and the
daily course of public business. For the sixteenth century they are only
preserved in a very fragmentary state as regards England; for the
seventeenth they lie before us, with gaps no doubt here and there, yet
in much greater completeness. Even in the first volume they have been
useful to me for Mary Tudor's reign and the end of Elizabeth's; in the
later ones, not only for James I's times, but also far more for Charles
I's government and his quarrel with the Parliament. Owing to the
geographical distance of Venice from England, and her neutral position
in the world, her ambassadors were able to devote an attention to
English affairs which is free from all interested motives, and sometimes
to observe their general course in close communication with the leading
men. We could not compose a history from the reports they give, but
combined with the documentary matter these reports form a very welcome
supplement to our knowledge.</p>

<p>Ambassadors who have to manage matters of all kinds, great and small, at
the courts to which they are accredited, fill their letters with
accounts of affairs which often contain little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
instruction for posterity, and they judge of a man according to the support which he
gives to their interests. This is the case with the French as well as
with other ambassadors in England. Nevertheless their correspondence
becomes gradually of the greatest value for my work. Their importance
grows with the importance of affairs. The two courts entered into the
most intimate relations: French politicians ceaselessly endeavoured to
gain influence over England, and sometimes with success. The
ambassadors' letters at such times refer to the weightiest matters of
state, and become invaluable; they rise to the rank of the most
important and instructive historical monuments. They have been hitherto,
in great part, unused.</p>

<p>In the Roman and Spanish reports also I found much which deserves to be
made known to the readers of history. The papers of Holland and the
Netherlands prove still more productive, as I show in detail at the end
of the narrative.</p>

<p>A historical work may aim either at putting forward a new view of what
is already known, or at communicating additional information as to the
facts. I have endeavoured to combine both these aims. </p>

<div class="footnotes">NOTES:

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> <i>Note to the third edition.</i>&mdash;In the course of my
researches for this work the representation of the seventeenth century
has occupied a larger space than I at first thought I should have been
able to give it; it forms the chief portion of the book in its present
form. I have therefore allowed myself the unwonted liberty of altering
the title so as to make this clear. Still the representation of the
sixteenth century, which is not now mentioned in the title, has not been
abridged on this account. The history of the Stuart dynasty and of
William III make up the central part of the edifice; what is given to
the earlier, as well as the later times may, if I may be allowed the
comparison, correspond to its two wings.</p></div>

<h2>TRANSLATORS' PREFACE.</h2>

<p>'The History of England, principally during the Seventeenth Century,'
which is here laid before the reader in an English form, is one of the
most important portions of that cycle of works on which Leopold von
Ranke has long been engaged. His History of the Popes, his History of
the Reformation in Germany, his French History, his work on the Ottomans
and the Spanish Monarchy, his Life of Wallenstein, his volume on the
Origin of the Thirty Years' War, and other smaller treatises, all aim at
delineating the international relations of the states of Europe. His
History of England may well be regarded as the concluding portion of
this series; for the relations of England, first with France, and then
with Holland, eventually determined the course of European politics.</p>

<p>The book however is more than a history of this period, for Professor
Ranke, according to his custom, has prefixed to it a luminous and
interesting sketch of the earlier part of our history, presented, as all
summaries ought to be, in the form of studies of the most important
epochs. And at the end of the work are Appendices, which supply not only
happy examples of historical criticism in the discussions on the chief
contemporary writers of the period, but also a mass of original
documents, most of which have never before been published. Above all,
the critiques on Clarendon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>
and Burnet, and the correspondence of
William III with Heinsius, will well repay careful study; and the
Appendices throw light on some of the more important details connected
with the history of the time, besides shewing the student how a great
master has found and used his materials.</p>

<p>The present translation was undertaken with the author's sanction, and
was intended in the first instance for the use of students in Oxford.
Its publication has been facilitated by a division of labour, the eight
volumes of the original having been entrusted each to a separate hand.
The translators are Messrs. C. W. Boase, Exeter College; W. W. Jackson,
Exeter College; H. B. George, New College; H. F. Pelham, Exeter College;
M. Creighton, Merton College; A. Watson, Brasenose College; G. W.
Kitchin, Christchurch; A. Plummer, Trinity College. The task of
oversight, of reducing inequalities of style, and of supervising the
Appendices and Index, has been performed by the editors, C. W. Boase and
G. W. Kitchin. Notwithstanding the disadvantages incident to a
translation, it is hoped that the work in its present shape will be
welcomed by a large number of English readers, and will help to increase
the deserved renown of the author in the country to the history of which
he has devoted such profound and fruitful study. </p>

<p class='center'><br />
THE CHIEF CRISES IN THE EARLIER HISTORY OF ENGLAND.
</p>

<p>As we turn over the pages of universal history, and follow the shifting
course of events, we perceive almost at the first glance one
comprehensive process of change going on, which, more than any other,
governs the external fortunes of the world. Through long periods of time
the historic life of the human race was active in Western Asia and in
the lands bordering on the Mediterranean which look towards the East:
there it laid the foundations of its higher culture. We may rightly
regard as the greatest event that meets us in the whole course of
authentic history, the fact that the seats of the predominant power and
culture have been transplanted to the Western lands and the shores of
the Atlantic Ocean. Not merely the abodes of the ancient civilised
nations, but even the capitals which were the medium of communication
between East and West, have fallen into barbarism; even the great
metropolis, from which first political, and then spiritual, dominion
extended itself in both directions over widespread territories, has not
maintained its rank. It was due to this tendency of things, combined
with a certain geographical cause, that neither could the medieval
Empire attain its full development, nor the Papacy continue to subsist
with unimpaired authority. From age to age the political and
intellectual life of the world transferred itself ever more and more to
the nations dwelling further West, especially since a new hemisphere was
opened up to their impulses of activity and extension. So it was that
the chief interests of the Pyrenean peninsula drew towards its ocean
coasts; that there grew up on either side of the Channel which separates
the Continent from Britain, the two great capitals in which modern
activity is chiefly concentrated; that Northern Germany, together with
the races which touch on the North Sea and the Baltic, developed a life
and a system of their own; it is in these regions latterly that the
universal spirit of the human race chiefly works out its task, and
displays its activity in moulding states, creating ideas, and
subjugating nature.</p>

<p>Yet this transmission, this transplanting, is not the work of a blind
destiny. While civilisation in the East succumbed and died out before
the advance of races incapable of culture, it was welcomed in the West
by races possessing the requisite capacity, which by their inborn force
gave it new forms and indestructible bases for its outward existence.
Nor have the nations and kingdoms arisen each from its mother earth, as
it were in obedience to some inward impulse of inevitable necessity, but
amid constant assimilation and rejection, ever repeated wars to secure
their future, and a ceaseless struggle with opposing elements that
threatened their ruin.</p>

<p>The object of universal history is to place before our eyes the leading
changes, and the conflicts of nations, together with their causes and
results. Our purpose is to depict the history of one of the chief of the
Western nations, the English, and that too in an age which decisively
modified both its inner constitution and its outward position in the
world, but it cannot be understood unless we first pourtray, with a few
quick touches, the historical events under the influence of which it
became civilised and great. </p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class='centersm'><a name="BI_I_I" id="BI_I_I"></a>
THE BRITONS, ROMANS, AND ANGLO-SAXONS.</p>

<p>The history of Western Europe in general opens with the struggle between
Kelts, Romans, and Germans, which determined out of what elements modern
nations should be formed.</p>

<p>Just as it is supposed that Albion in early times was connected with the
Continent, and only separated from it by the raging sea-flood which
buried the intermediate lands in the abyss, so in ethnographic relations
it would seem as if the aboriginal Keltic tribes of the island had been
only separated by some accident from those which occupied Gaul and the
Netherlands. The Channel is no national boundary. We find Belgians in
Britain, Britons in Eastern Gaul, and very many names of peoples common
to both coasts; there were tribes which, though separated by the sea,
yet acknowledged the same prince. Without being able to prove how far
natives of the island took part in the expeditions of conquest, which
pouring forth from Gaul inundated the countries on the Danube and Italy,
Greece and Western Asia, we yet can trace the affinity of names and
tribes as far as these expeditions extend. This island was the home of
the religion that gave a certain unity to the populations, which, though
closely akin, nevertheless contended with each other in ceaseless
discord. It was that Druidic discipline which combined a priestly
constitution with civil privileges, and with a very peculiar doctrine of
a political and even moral purport. We might be tempted to suppose that
the atrocity of human sacrifice was first introduced among them by the
Punic race. For they were from primeval times connected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>with the
Carthaginians and Phoenicians, who were the first to traverse the outer
sea, and sought in the island a metal which was very valuable for the
wants of the ancient world. Distant clans might retain in the mountains
their original wildness, but the southern coasts ranked in the earliest
times as rich and civilised. They stood within the circle of the
relations that had been created by the expeditions of the Keltic tribes,
by the mixture of peoples thence arising, by the war and commerce of the
earliest age.</p>

<p>In the great war between Rome and Carthage, which decided the destiny of
the ancient world, the Keltic tribes took part as allies of the Punic
race. If Carthage had conquered, they would have maintained in most, if
not all, the lands they had occupied, and especially in their own homes,
their old manners and customs, and their religion in its existing form.
It was not merely the supremacy of the one city or the other, but the
future of Western Europe that was at stake when Hannibal attacked the
Romans in Italy. Rome, which had already grown strong in warring against
the Gauls, won the victory over the Carthaginians. Thenceforth one after
another of the Keltic nations succumbed to the superiority of the Roman
arms, which at last invaded Transalpine Gaul, and struck its military
power to the ground.</p>

<p>From this point the reaction against the Keltic enterprises necessarily
extended itself also to Britain.</p>

<p>The great general who conquered Gaul did not feel sure of being able to
accomplish his task unless he also obtained influence over the British
tribes, from which those of the Continent constantly received help and
encouragement, unless he established among them the authority of the
Roman name.</p>

<p>It was an important moment in the world's history, well worthy of
remembrance, when Caesar first trod the soil of Albion. Already repulsed
from the steep chalk cliffs of the island, he found the flat shore on
which he hoped to disembark occupied by the enemy, some in their
war-chariots, others on horseback and on foot; his ships could not reach
the shore; the soldiers hesitated, encumbered with their armour as they
were, to throw themselves into a sea with which they were not familiar,
in presence of an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
enemy acquainted with the ground, active, brave, and
superior in numbers; the general's order had no effect on them; when
however an eagle-bearer, calling on the gods of Rome, threw himself into
the flood, the men would have thought themselves traitors had they
allowed the war-standard, to which an almost divine worship was paid, to
fall into the hands of the enemy; fired by the danger that threatened
their honour, and by the religion of arms, from one ship after another
they followed him to the fight; in the hand-to-hand combat in the water
which ensued they gained the superiority, supported most skilfully by
their general wherever it was necessary; the moment they reached the
land, the victory was won.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>We cannot reckon it a slight matter, that Caesar, though not at the
first, yet at the second and better prepared expedition, succeeded in
carrying away with him hostages from the chief tribes. For this very
form was the one customary in that century and among those tribes, by
which he bound them and their princes to himself.</p>

<p>It was the first step towards the Roman supremacy. But Gaul and West
Germany had first to be subdued, and the Empire securely concentrated in
one hand, before&mdash;a century later&mdash;the conquest of the island could be
really attempted.</p>

<p>Even then the Britons still fought without helmet or shield, as did the
Gauls of old before Rome. In Britain, just as on the Lombard plains, the
war-chariot was their best arm; their defective mode of defence
necessarily yielded to the organised tactics of the legion. How easily
did the Romans, pushing forward under cover of their mantelets, clear
away the rude entrenchments by which the Britons used formerly to secure
themselves against attack. The Druids on Mona trusted in their gods,
whose will they thought to ascertain from the quivering fibres of human
sacrifices; and for a moment the sight of the crowd of fanatics
collected around them checked the attack, but only for a moment: as soon
as they came to blows they were instantly scattered, and their holy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
places perished with them. For this is the greatest result of the Roman
wars, that they destroyed the rites which contradicted the idea of
Humanity. Yet once more an injured princess&mdash;Boadicea&mdash;united all the
sympathies which the old constitution and religion could awaken. Dio has
depicted her, doubtless according to the reports which reached Rome. A
tall form, with the national decoration of the golden necklace and the
chequered mantle, over which her rich yellow hair flowed down below her
waist. She called on her peoples to defend themselves at any risk, since
what could befall those to whom each root gave nourishment, each tree
supplied shelter: and on her gods, not to let the land pass into the
possession of that insatiable, unjust foe of foreign race. So truly does
she represent the innate characteristics of the British race, when
oppressed and engaged in a desperate defence. She is earnest, rugged,
and terrible; the men who gathered round her were reckoned by hundreds
of thousands. But the Britons had not yet learnt the art of war. A
single onslaught of the Romans sufficed to scatter their disorderly
masses with a fearful butchery. It was the last day of the old British
independence. Boadicea would not, any more than Cleopatra, adorn a Roman
triumph; she fell by her own hand.</p>

<p>Within a few dozen years the Roman eagles were masters of Britain as far
as the Highlands: the Keltic clan-life and the religion of the Druids
withdrew into the Caledonian mountains, and the large islands off that
coast; in the conquered territory the religion of the arms that had won
the victory, and the might of the Great Empire, were supreme. The work
which was begun by superiority in war was completed by pre-eminence in
civilisation. It seemed an advantage and an improvement to the sons of
the British princes, to adopt the Roman language, and knowledge, and
mode of life; they delighted in the luxury of colonnades, baths, feasts,
and city life. Men like Agricola used these modes of Romanising Britain
by preference. Just as the Britons exchanged their rude shipbuilding and
their leathern sails for the discoveries of a more advanced art of
navigation, so they learnt to carry on their agriculture in Roman
fashion; in later times Britain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
was considered as the granary of the
legions in Germany. Most of the cities in the land betray by their very
names their Roman origin; London, though it existed earlier, owes its
importance to this connexion. It was the emporium destined as it were by
nature for the peaceful commerce that now arose between the Western
provinces of the Empire. Once in the third century an attempt was made
to make the island independent, but it failed the moment the marts on
the opposite coast fell into the hands of the Emperor who was
universally recognised. Britain seemed an integral part of the Roman
Empire. It was from York that Constantine marched forth to unite its
Eastern and Western halves once more under one government.</p>

<p>But soon after him an epoch began in which the third great nationality,
at first thought to be part of the Keltic race, then driven back or
taken into service by the Romans, but always maintaining its peculiar
original independence&mdash;the German, rose to supremacy in the West. In the
fifth century it had become everywhere master in the
militarily-organised Roman frontier districts: encouraged by the
embarrassments of the authorities it advanced into the peaceful
provinces.</p>

<p>It is of importance to remark what the fate of Britain was in these
struggles.</p>

<p>From the Romanised territory an Augustus, called Constantine, set up by
the revolted legions, invaded Gaul, not merely to check the inroads of
the barbarians, but at the same time to possess himself of the Empire.
He at one time held a great position, when the legions of Gaul and
Aquitaine also took his side, and Spain saluted him Emperor. But the
authority of Honorius the generally recognised Emperor could not be so
easily set aside: discontented followers of the new Augustus again went
over to the old one: before them and the barbarians combined Constantine
fell, and soon after paid for his attempt with his life.</p>

<p>The result, then, was that Honorius restored his authority to a certain
extent everywhere on the Continent, but not in Britain. To the towns
which had taken up arms while Constantine was there he gave the right of
self-defence&mdash;he could do nothing for them. The Roman Empire was not
exactly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> overthrown in Britain&mdash;it ceased
to be.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>At this time, when the connexion between Rome and Roman Britain was
broken off, the Germans possessed themselves of the latter country.</p>

<p class='sect'><a name="BI_I_II" id="BI_I_II"></a>The Anglo-Saxons and Christianity.</p>

<p>Germans had been long ago settled in this as in so many other provinces
of the Western and Eastern Empires. Antoninus had brought over German
tribes from the Danube, Probus others from the Rhineland. In the legions
we find German cohorts, and very many others joined them as free allies.
In the civil wars between the Emperors we hear of one side relying on
the Franks, the other on the Alemanni in their service; Constantine the
Great is called to be Caesar by help of the chiefs of the Alemanni. But
besides this, German seafarers, who appeared under the name of Saxons,
after they had learnt shipbuilding and navigation from the Romans,
settled on the opposite coasts of Britain and Gaul, and gave their name
to both. Not then for the first time, nor at the invitation of the
Britons, as the Saga declares,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
did the descendants of Wodan make
their first trial of the sea in light vessels. Alternating between
piracy and alliance&mdash;now with a usurper and now with the lawful Emperor,
between independence and subjection, German seafarers had long ago
filled all seas and coasts with the terror of their name. In the North
too they are mentioned together with Scots and Attacotti. When now the
Roman rule over the island and the surrounding seas came to an end, to
whom could it pass? To the peaceful Provincials, if they could indeed
gird on the sword, or to the old companions in arms of the Romans?
There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
is no doubt that the same general impulse which urged on the
German peoples, in the great revolution of affairs, into the Roman
provinces, led the enterprising inhabitants of the German and Northern
coasts, Frisians, Angles, and Jutes, as well as Saxons, into Britain. A
fearful war broke out, in which it may be true to say the ruined towns
became the sepulchres of their inhabitants, but no man found the quiet
time necessary for depicting its details. After it had filled a century
and a half with its horrors, and men again lifted up their eyes, they
found the island divided between two great nationalities, which had
separated themselves as opposing forces. The natives had as good as
abandoned the civilisation they had learnt from Rome, and leant on their
kinsfolk in North Gaul, and the Scots in Ireland and the Highlands; they
occupied the west of the island. The Germans were settled in the east,
in the greatest part of the south, and in the north, in most of the old
Roman settlements,&mdash;but they were far from forming a united body. Not
seven or eight merely, but a large number of little tribal kingdoms,
occupied or fought for the ground.</p>

<p>If we wish to point out in general the distinction between the
Anglo-Saxon and other German settlements, it lies in this, that they
rested neither on the Emperor's authorisation whether direct or
indirect, nor on any agreement with the natives of the land. In Gaul
Chlodwig assumed and carried on the authority of the Roman Empire;&mdash;in
Britain it went wholly to the ground. Hence it was that here the German
ideas could develop in their full purity, more so than in Germany
itself, over which the Frankish monarchy, which had also adopted Roman
tendencies, had gained influence.</p>

<p>Just as the natives who would not submit were driven out of the German
settlements, so within their boundaries the germs of Christianity, which
had already spread in the island, were as good as annihilated. Among the
victorious Germans the Northern heathenism existed in full strength. In
many names of places, at the water-springs, the watersheds, in the
designations of the days of the week, the names of the gods of Germany
and the North appear; the kings trace their descent directly from them
as their immediate ancestors; the Sagas and poems about them symbolise
those battles with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
the elements, the storm, the sea, and the powers of
nature, which are peculiarly characteristic of the Northern mythology.
With this, however, arose the question, so important for the history of
the world, whether the great territory already won for the ideas of the
universal culture and religion of mankind should be again lost.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the 6th century the epoch began in which, as the
German invaders of Gaul had already done, so now those of Spain and
Italy, whether Arians or heathens, came over to the Catholic faith of
the Provincials. This took place under the mediation of the chief
Pontiff, who had raised the city, from which the Empire took its name,
to be the metropolis of the Faith. Lombards and Visigoths became as good
Catholics as the Franks already were. The relationship of the royal
families, which held all Germans in close connexion, and the zeal of
Rome, which could not possibly suffer the loss of a province that it had
once possessed, now combined to call forth a similar movement among the
Anglo-Saxons, yet one which worked itself out in a very different way.
Since among the natives a peculiar form of church-life, not unconnected
with the Druidic discipline, had arisen, with which Rome would hold no
communion, and which rejected all demands of submission, the spiritual
enmity of the missionary was united to the national enmity of the
conqueror. When a king still heathen, while attacking the Britons,
directed his weapons against the monks of Bangor, who (collected on a
height) were offering up prayers against him, and massacred them to the
number of twelve hundred, the followers of the Roman Mission saw in this
a punishment decreed by God for apostasy, and the fulfilment of the
prophecies of their apostle.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
On the other hand British Christian
kings also made common cause with the heathen Angles, and wasted with
fire and sword the provinces that had been converted by Rome. Had not in
the vicissitudes of internal war the native church organisation of the
North<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
won influence over the Anglo-Saxons, heathenism would never have
been conquered; it would have always found support among the Britons.</p>

<p>When this however had once taken place, the whole Anglo-Saxon name
attached itself to the Roman ritual. Among the motives for this change
those which corresponded to the naive materialistic superstition of the
time may have been the most influential, yet there were other motives
also which touched the very essence of the matter. Men wished to belong
to the great Church Communion which then in still unbroken freedom
comprehended the most distant nations.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
They preferred the bishops
whom the kings appointed (with the authorisation of the Roman See), to
those over whom the abbot of the great monastery on the island of Iona
exercised a kind of supremacy. Here there was no question of any
agreement between the German king and the bishops of the land, as under
the Merovingians in Gaul; they even avoided restoring the bishops' sees
which had flourished in the old Roman times in Britain. The primitive
and independent element manifests itself in the decision of the princes
and their great men. In Northumberland, Christianity was introduced by a
formal resolution of the King and his Witan: a heathen high priest girt
himself with the sword, and even with his own hand threw down his idols.
The Anglo-Saxon tribes in fact passed over from the popular religion and
mythology of the North and of Germany, which would have kept them in
barbarism, to the communion of the universal religion, to which belonged
the civilisation of the world. Never did a race show itself more
susceptible of such an influence: it presents the most remarkable
example of how the old German ideas, which had now taken living root in
this soil, and the Roman ecclesiastical culture, which was vigorously
embraced, met and became intertwined. The first German who made the
universal learning, derived from antiquity, his own, was an Anglo-Saxon,
the Venerable Beda; the first German dialect in which men wrote history
and drew up laws, was likewise the Anglo-Saxon.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
Despite all their reverence for the threshold of the Apostles they admitted foreign
priests no longer than was indispensable for the foundation of the new
church: in the gradual progress of the conversion they were no longer
needed, we soon find Anglo-Saxon names everywhere in the church: the
archbishops and leading bishops are as closely related to the royal
families, as the heathen high priests had been before.</p>

<p>It was exactly through the co-operation of both principles, originally
so foreign to one another, that the Anglo-Saxon nature took firm and
lasting form.</p>

<p>The Kelts had formerly lived under a clan system which, extending over
vast districts, yet displayed in each spot characteristic weaknesses
which the hostility of every neighbour rendered fatal. Then the Romans
had introduced a military administrative constitution, which displaced
this tribal system, while it also subjected Britain to the universal
Empire, of which it formed only an unimportant province. A
characteristic form of life was first built up in Britain by the
Anglo-Saxons on the ruins of the Roman rule. The union into which they
entered with the civilised world was the freely chosen one of the
religion of the human race; they had no other connexion to control them.
Their whole energies being concentrated on the island, they gave it for
the first time, though continually at war with each other, an
independent position.</p>

<p>Their constitution combines the ideas of the army and the tribe: it is
the constitution of armies of colonists bringing with them domestic
institutions which had been theirs from time immemorial. A society of
freemen of the same stock, who divided the soil among themselves in such
a manner that the number of the hides corresponded to that of the
families (for among no people was there a stronger conception of
separate ownership), they composed the armed array of the country, and
by their union maintained that peace at home which again secured each
man's life and property. At their head stands a royal family, of the
highest nobility, which traces its origin to the gods, and has by far
the largest possessions; from it, by birth and by election combined,
proceeds the King; who then, sceptre in hand, presides in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
the court of justice, and in the field has the banner carried before him; he is the
Lord, to whom men owe fidelity; the Guardian, to whom the public roads
and navigable rivers belong, who disposes of the undivided land. Yet he
does not stand originally so high above other men that his murder cannot
be expiated by a wergeld, of which one share falls to his family&mdash;not a
larger one than for any other of its members,&mdash;and the other to the
collective community, since the prince belongs to the former by birth,
to the latter by his office. Between the simple freeman and the prince
appear the eorls, ealdormen, and thanes, in some instances raised above
the mass by noble birth or by larger possessions, natural chiefs of
districts and hundreds, in others promoted by service in the King's
court and in the field, sometimes specially bound to him by personal
allegiance: they are the Witan who have elected him out of his family
(in a few instances they depose him); they concur in giving laws, they
take part in making peace. Now the bishops take place by their side.
They appear with the ealdormen in the judicial meetings of the counties:
if the Gerefa neglects his duty, it is for them to step in; yet they
have also their own spiritual jurisdiction. It is a spiritual and
temporal organisation of small extent, yet of a certain self-sufficing
completeness. Many of the present shires correspond to the old kingdoms,
and bear their names to this day. The bishops' sees often coincide with
the seats of royalty; for the kings wished each to have a bishop to
himself in his little territory, since they had to endow the bishopric.
How many regulations still in force date from these times!</p>

<p>The Anglo-Saxons always had an immediate and near relation to the
kingdom of the Franks.</p>

<p>It was with the daughter of a Frankish prince that the first impulse
towards conversion came into a Saxon royal house. By the Anglo-Saxons
again the conversion of inner Germany was carried out, in opposition to
the same Scoto-Irish element which they withstood in Britain. Carl the
Great thought it expedient to inform the Mercian King Offa of the
progress of Christianity among the Saxons in Germany: he looked on him
as his natural ally. Both kingdoms had moreover
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
a common interest as against the free British populations on their western marches, who were
allied with each other across the sea: decisive campaigns of Carl the
Great and King Egbert of Wessex coincide in point of time, and may have
supported each other.</p>

<p>Similarly, we may suppose that Egbert, who lived a number of years as an
exile at Carl's court, and could not have remained uninfluenced by his
mode of government and improved military tactics, was then also incited
and enabled, after his return, to subdue the little kingdoms and unite
them with Wessex: by the side of the 'Francia' of the continent he
created in the island a united 'Anglia.' But still there subsisted a yet
greater difference. Sprung from the stock of Cerdic, Egbert belonged to
the popular royalty which we find throughout at the head of the invading
Germans; he is, so far, more like the Merovingians whom Carl's
predecessors overthrew, than like Carl himself; and he was almost
entirely destitute of that strong groundwork of military institutions on
which the Carolingians supported themselves. His rise depended much more
on the fact that the old families in Mercia, Northumbria, and Kent had
disappeared, and the succession in general had become doubtful; after
Egbert had conquered the claimants to the throne in a great and bloody
battle, he was recognised by the Witans of the several kingdoms as their
common prince, and his family as that which in fact it now was,&mdash;the
leading one of all. After the example of Pipin's family, whose alliance
with the Papacy was the most important historical event of the epoch and
founded Western Christendom, the descendants of Cerdic also got
themselves anointed by the popes&mdash;for the religious movement still had
the predominance over every other. The amalgamation of the tribes and
kingdoms found its expression in the Church, through the prestige and
rank of the Archbishop of Canterbury, almost earlier than it did in the
State; the unity of the Church broke down the antipathies of the tribes,
and prepared the way for that of the kingdoms. In the midst of this work
of construction, so incomplete as yet, but so full of hope, of these
birthpangs of a new life, the very existence of the country was
threatened by the rise of a new Great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
Power. For so may we well designate the influence which the Scandinavian North exercised by land
over Eastern Europe, and at the same time over all the Western coasts by
sea.</p>

<p>Only a part of the German peoples had been influenced by the idea of the
Empire or the Church; the inborn heathenism of the rest, irritated by
the losses it had sustained and the dangers that continually threatened
it, roused itself for the most formidable onslaught that the civilised
world has ever had to withstand from the heroic and barbarous children
of Nature.</p>

<p>The mischief they wrought in Britain, from the middle of the ninth
century onwards, is indescribable.</p>

<p>The Scoto-Irish schools, then in their most flourishing state (they
trained John Scotus Erigena, of all the scholars of that time the man
who had the widest intellectual range), fell before the Danish, not the
Anglo-Saxon assaults; an element of intellectual activity which might
have been of the greatest importance was thus lost to the Western world.
But the Northmen persecuted the Romano-English forms as bitterly as they
did the Irish. In the places where those Anglo-Saxon scholars had been
trained, who then enlightened the West, the Northmen planted the banner
which announced utter destruction; with twofold rapacity they threw
themselves on the more remote abbeys which seemed to derive protection
from their inaccessibility, and to guarantee it by their dignity; in
searching for the treasures which they believed had been placed in them
for security, they destroyed the monuments and means of instruction
which were really there; in Medeshamstede, where there was a rich
library, the flames raged for fourteen days. The half-formed union of
the various districts into one kingdom seems to have crippled rather
than strengthened the power of local resistance: the Danes became
masters of Kent and of East-Anglia, of Northumberland, and even of
Mercia; at last Wessex too, after already suffering many losses, was
invaded; from both sides at the same moment, from the inland and from
the coast, the deluge of robber-hordes poured over its whole extent.</p>

<p>Things had come to such a point that the Anglo-Saxon community seemed
inevitably devoted to the same ruin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
which had overtaken first the
Britons and then the Romans, they seemed doomed to make way for another
reconstruction. Britain would have become an outpost of the restored
heathenism, which could then have been with difficulty repulsed from the
Eastern and Western Frankish empires, afflicted as they were by similar
attacks, and governed by the discordant and weak princes who then ruled
them. At this moment of peril King Alfred appeared. It was not merely
for his own interests, nor merely for those of England, but for those of
the world, that he fought. He is rightly called 'the Great;' a title
fairly due only to those who have maintained great universal interests,
and not merely those of their own country.</p>

<p>The distress of the moment, and the deliverance from it, have been kept
in imperishable remembrance by popular sagas and church legends. It is
well worth the trouble to trace out in the authenticated traditions,
brief as they are, the causes that decided the event. We may state them
as follows:&mdash;Since the attacks of the Vikings were especially ruinous,
from their occupation of the strong places whence they could command and
plunder the open country, one step in the work of liberation was taken
when Alfred, for the first time, wrested from them a stronghold which
they had seized, deep in the west. Then he, too, occupied strong
positions, and knew how to defend them. With the bravest and most
devoted of his nobles, and of the population that had not yet submitted,
he established a hill-fortress on a height rising like an island out of
the standing waters and marshlands in the still only slightly cultivated
land of Somersetshire; this not only served him as an asylum, but also
as a central point from which he too ranged through the land far and
wide, like the enemy, except that his object was to guard it, and make
it ring once more with the already forgotten name of the King. Around
his banners gathered, with reviving courage, the population of the
neighbouring districts also: the Saxons could again appear in the open
field; from their advancing shield-wall the disorderly onsets of the
Vikings recoiled, the victory was theirs. Hereupon, moreover, as if the
decision between the two religions depended on the result of the war,
the leader of the heathens
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
came over to Christianity, and took an
Anglo-Saxon name. The Danes attached themselves to the principles and
the powers which they had come forth to destroy.</p>

<p>King Alfred is a marvellous phenomenon: suffering from a disease which
sometimes broke out with violence, and which he never ceased to feel for
a single day of his life, he not merely withstood the extreme of peril
at that moment so big with ruin, but also founded a system of resistance
throughout the kingdom, in which his arms so worked together by sea and
land that each new band of Vikings betook themselves again to their
ships, and those that had already penetrated into the country, gave way
step by step. We remark with interest how, under Alfred and his
children, his son who succeeded him, and his manlike daughter, the
protecting fortresses advance from place to place, and provide free
space for the Anglo-Saxon community. The culture already existing, the
whole future of which had been saved by Alfred, attained in him its
fullest development. How many years had passed since the hour when an
illuminated initial letter gave him his first taste for a book, before
he could master even the elementary branches of knowledge! then he
devoted his whole efforts to instil new life into the studies that had
almost perished, and to give them a national character. He not merely
translated a number of the later authors of antiquity, whose works had
contributed most to the transmission of scientific culture; in the
episodes which he interweaves in them he shows a desire for knowledge
that reaches far beyond them; but especially we find in them a
reflective and thoughtful mind, solid sense at peace with itself, a
fresh way of viewing the world, a lively power of observation. This King
introduced the German mind with its learning and reflection into the
literature of the world; he stands at the head of the prose-writers and
historians in a German tongue&mdash;the people's King of the most primeval
kind, who is also the teacher of his people. We know his laws, in which
extracts from the books of Moses are combined with restored legal usages
of German origin; in him the traditions of antiquity are interpenetrated
by the original tendencies of the German mind. We completely weaken the
impression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
made on us by this great figure, so important in his first
limited and arduous efforts, by comparing him with the brilliant names
of antiquity. Each man is what he is in his own place.</p>

<p>Though the Anglo-Saxon monarchy wanted that element of authority which
the kings of other German tribes drew from the Roman government by
transmission or succession, yet it had strengthened itself, like the
others, by union with the Church. Alfred, too, was at Rome in his
boyhood: it stood him in good stead that he had been anointed, and, as
men said, adopted by a Roman pope. In the reconquest of the land, Church
ideas had played an important part. It was impossible to drive out the
invading foes, they could only be held in check; never would they have
submitted to the Anglo-Saxon commonwealth had they not at the same time
been converted to Christianity. Nothing, moreover, contributed more to
this than the effort, which was then the order of the day in the
Christian world, to base the organisation of the Church on monasticism:
from Italy this tendency spread to Germany, from South France to North,
from thence to England, where it produced its greatest effect. Now the
power of conversion is inherent only in sharply-defined doctrines; and
it was precisely this tendency that penetrated the Northern natures: the
sons of the Vikings became the champions of monachism; to the fury with
which the fathers had destroyed the monasteries succeeded in the sons a
zeal to restore them. And in what good stead this stood the Anglo-Saxon
kings! The kingly power obtained, through the splendour which the union
with religion bestowed on its victorious arms, a reverential recognition
by the old native population as well as by the invaders.</p>

<p>Alfred's grandson had regained Northumbria by a somewhat doubtful title,
and had then maintained his right in a great battle, renowned in song;
his great-grandson, Edgar, in one of his charters thanks the grace of
God which had permitted him to extend his rule further than his
predecessors, over the islands and seas as far as Norway, and over a
great part of Ireland. We are not to look on it as a mere piece of
vanity, when he seeks after new titles for his power, when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
he calls himself Basileus and Imperator; the former is the title of the Eastern,
the latter of the Western emperors; he will not yield the precedence to
either the one or the other, though the latter are so closely related to
him by blood. We cannot express the feeling of a supreme power,
independent of men, derived from the grace of God, the King of kings,
more strongly than it was expressed by Edgar under Dunstan's influence;
the ruling motives of life in Church and State make it conceivable that
a monkish hierarch, such as Dunstan, shared, as it were, the King's
power, and shaped the course of the authority of the state.</p>

<p>It was still the ancestral Anglo-Saxon crown which glittered on Edgar's
head, but, if we may so say, its splendour had at the same time received
a monkish and hierarchic colouring. </p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class='centersm'><a name="BI_II" id="BI_II"></a>
TRANSFER OF THE ANGLO-SAXON CROWN TO THE NORMANS AND PLANTAGENETS.</p>

<p>In the families of German national kings we not unfrequently find among
the women a hideous mixture of ambition, revenge, and bloodthirstiness,
which brings kings and kingdoms to ruin. In England it appears, despite
of Christianity and monastic discipline, in its most atrocious form
after the death of Edgar. His eldest son, for some years his successor,
was treacherously murdered by his stepmother (who wished to advance her
own son to the throne), at a visit which he paid her as he returned from
hunting. It was that Edward whose innocence and leaning towards the
Church have gained him the name of Martyr. The son of the murderess did
ascend the throne, but the guilt of blood seemed to cleave to the crown;
he met with the obedience of his father's times no more. The Anglo-Saxon
magnates seized the occasion which this crime, or the subsequent
vacillation of the government between violence and weakness, offered
them, to aim at an independent position, and to indulge in a personal
policy, each man for himself.</p>

<p>At this very moment the Danes renewed their invasions.</p>

<p>Little did Edgar and those around him understand their position, when
they attributed the peace they enjoyed to their own military power, in
the splendid and extensive display of which they took delight. In
reality it was the state of the world at large that brought this peace
about. First of all, it was due to the settlement of the Normans in
North Gaul, under the condition that they should be of one religion and
one realm, and should fulfil the natural duty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
of keeping off fresh incursions: the current of Northern invasion thus lost its aim and
direction. But it was of still more decisive effect at the first that
the energetic family which arose in North Germany, and even assumed the
imperial authority, not content with warding off the Danes, sought them
out in their own country instead, and carried the war against heathenism
into the North. The Saxons beyond the sea were indebted for the peace
which they enjoyed chiefly to the great and splendid deeds of arms of
their kindred on the mainland. How much all depended on this became very
clear when Otto II, in the full glow of great enterprises, met with an
unlooked for and early death. Within the empire two able women and their
advisers succeeded in maintaining peace; but in Denmark, as in other
neighbouring countries, the hostile elements got the upper hand. The
Danish king's son, Sven Otto, abandoned the religion which he regarded
as a yoke laid on him by the German conquerors; he could not destroy the
order of things established in Denmark, but he revived the old
sea-king's life, and threw himself with the old superiority of the
Viking arms on the English coasts.</p>

<p>Ethelred on this attack fell into the greatest distress, mainly because
he was not sure of his great nobles. How often did the commanders of the
fleet desert it at the moment of action, and the leaders of the inland
levies go over to the enemy! Ethelred sought for safety by an alliance
with the Duchy of Normandy, then daily rising to greater power. Thus
supported, he proceeded to unjustifiable outrages against his domestic
as well as his foreign foes. The great nobles whom he suspected were
mercilessly killed or exiled, and their children blinded. The Danes who
remained in the land he caused to be murdered all on one day.</p>

<p>The consequences of this deed necessarily recoiled upon himself. When
Sven some years after again landed with redoubled enmity, which was to a
certain extent justified, he experienced no effectual resistance
whatever; Ethelred had to fly before him and quit the island. But now
that Sven too, who had been already saluted by many as King, died in the
first enjoyment of his victory, a question
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
arose which extended far beyond the personal relations and embarrassments of the moment.</p>

<p>The influence always exercised by the Witans of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms
in determining the succession to the throne remained much the same when
they were all fused into a single kingdom; even among the descendants of
Alfred, the great men designated the sovereign. In the disturbed state
of things in which they now found themselves, the lawful King having
fled, and the other, who had put himself into actual possession of the
supreme authority, being dead, they framed the largest conception of
their right. They formally made conditions with Ethelred for his return,
and he consented to their demands through his
son.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
Since he, however,
did not fulfil his promise&mdash;for how could he have altered his
nature?&mdash;they held themselves released from their engagement to maintain
this family on the throne. Sven's son, Canute, had taken his father's
place among the Danes; he had been long ago baptised, he was of a
character which commanded confidence, and possessed at the time
overwhelming power. After Ethelred's death the lay and spiritual chiefs
of England decided to abandon the house of Cerdic for ever, and to
recognise Canute as their King. How many jarls and thanes of Danish
origin do we find around the kings under all the last governments. Edgar
was especially blamed for the very reason that he took them under his
protection. But they had been subjected only by war; no hereditary
sentiment of natural loyalty attached them to the West Saxon royal
house. The ecclesiastical aristocracy was besides determined by
religious considerations; to them these disasters and crimes seemed
sufficient proof of the truth of those prophecies of coming woe which
Dunstan was believed to have uttered. They repaired to Canute at
Southampton, and concluded a peace with him, the conditions of which
were that they would abandon the descendants of Ethelred for ever, and
recognise Canute as their King; he, on the other hand, promised to
fulfil the duties of a King truly, in both spiritual and temporal
relations.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
Yet once more, Ethelred's eldest son, Edmund
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
Ironsides, who was himself half a Dane by birth, roused himself to a vigorous
resistance: London and a part of the nobility took his side; he gained
through force of arms a settlement by which, though indeed he lost the
best part of the land and the capital itself, he maintained the crown;
he died however, soon after, and then the whole country recognised
Canute as King. The last scion of the royal house in the land was
banished, and all the claims of the family to the crown again declared
void. The Anglo-Saxon magnates undertook to make a money payment to the
Danish host; in return they received the pledge from the King's hand,
and the oath by his soul taken by his chiefs.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
It was a treaty between
the Anglo-Saxon and the Danish chiefs, by which the former received the
King of the latter as also their own.</p>

<p>This extremely important event links the centuries together, and
determines the future fortunes of England. The kingly house, whose right
and pre-eminence was connected with the earliest settlements, which had
completed the union of the realm and delivered it from the worst
distress, was at a moment of moral deterioration and disaster excluded
by the spiritual and temporal chiefs, of Anglo-Saxon and Danish origin.
They had first tried to limit it, to bind it by its own promise; when
this led to nothing, they annihilated its right by a formal resolution
of the realm, and procured peace by raising to the throne another
sovereign who had no right by birth. Canute did not owe the crown to
conquest, though his greater power contributed to the result, but to
election, which now appeared as the superior right: hitherto the Witan
had always exercised it within the limits of the royal family; this time
they disregarded that family altogether.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
Canute decreed or allowed some bloody acts of violence, in order to
strengthen the power that had fallen to his lot; but afterwards he
administered it with a noble spirit answering to his position. He became
the leading sovereign of the North: men reckoned five or six kingdoms as
subject to him. England was the chief of them all, even for him; it was
in possession of the culture and religion which he wished should prevail
in the rest: the missionaries of the North went forth from Canterbury.
England itself, however, gained a higher position in the world by its
union with a power which ruled as far as Norway and North America, and
carried on commerce with the East by the Baltic. In Gothland the great
emporium of the West, Arabic as well as Anglo-Danish coins are found;
the former were carried from the North as far as England. Canute
favoured the Anglo-Saxon mode of life; he liked to be designated the
'successor of Edgar;' he confirmed his legislation; and it was his
intention, at least, to rule according to the laws: as he even submitted
himself to the military regulations of the Huskarls, so he commanded
right and law to be administered in civil matters without respect to his
own person.</p>

<p>But a union of such different kingdoms could only be a transitory
phenomenon. Canute himself thought of leaving England again independent
under one of his sons.</p>

<p>With this object he had married Ethelred's widow Emma. For, according to
Anglo-Saxon ideas, the Queen was not merely the King's wife, but also
sovereign of the land, in her own right. It was settled that the
children of this marriage should succeed him in England. Probably Canute
did not wish the inheritance of the crown in his house to depend merely
on the goodwill of the Witan.</p>

<p>After Canute's death we can observe a wavering between the principles of
election and birthright. The magnates again elected, but limited their
choice to the King's house. After the extinction of the Danish-Norman
family, they came back to the English-Norman one; they called the son of
Ethelred and Emma, Edward the Confessor, to the throne of his fathers,
though, it is true, without leaving him much power. This lay rather in
the hands of the Earls Godwin of Kent and Leofric of Mercia; especially
in the former,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
whose wife was related to Canute, did the Anglo-Saxon
spirit of independence energetically manifest itself. He was once
banished, but returned and recovered all his offices. When however,
Edward too died without issue, the dynastic question once more came
before the English magnates. It might have seemed most consistent to
recall the Aetheling Edgar a member of the house of Cerdic from exile,
and to carry on the previous form of government under his name. But the
thoughts of the English chiefs no longer turned in that direction. Not
very long before a king from the ranks of the native nobility had
ascended the throne of the Carolingians in the West Frank empire; in the
East Frank, or German empire, men had seen first the mightiest duke,
then one of the most distinguished counts, attain the imperial dignity.
Why should it not be possible for something similar to happen in England
also? The very day on which Edward the Confessor died, Godwin's son,
Harold, was elected by the magnates of the kingdom, and crowned without
delay<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
(Jan. 5, 1066). The event now happened which was only implied
in what occurred at Canute's accession: the house of Cerdic was
abandoned, and the further step taken of raising another native family
to its throne.</p>

<p>It was not this time a pressing necessity that brought it about; but we
cannot deny that, if carried through, it opened out an immeasurable
prospect.</p>

<p>For such would have been the case, if the attempt to found a Germanic
Anglo-Saxon kingdom under Harold, and maintain it free from any
preponderating foreign influence had been successful. By recalling Edgar
the influence of Normandy, against which the antipathies of the nation
had been awakened under the last government, would have been renewed.
But just as little were those claims to be recognised which the Northern
kings put forward for the re-establishment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span> of their supremacy. Even as
regards the Papacy, the government began to adopt an independent line of
conduct.</p>

<p>The question now was, whether the Anglo-Saxon nation would be unanimous
and strong enough to maintain such a haughty position on all sides.</p>

<p>The first attack came from the North; it was all the more dangerous,
from the fact that an ambitious brother of the new King supported it:
only by an extreme effort were these enemies repelled. But, at the same
moment, an attack was threatened from another enemy of infinitely
greater importance&mdash;Duke William of Normandy. It was not only this
sovereign, and his land, but a new phase of development in the history
of the world, with which England now entered into conflict.</p>

<p class='sect'><a name="BI_II_I" id="BI_II_I"></a>The Conquest.</p>

<p>Out of the antagonism of nationalities, of the Empire and the Church, of
the overlord and the great chiefs, in the midst of invasions of foreign
peoples and armies, the local resistance to them and their occupations
of territory, a new world had, as it were, been forming itself in
Southern Europe, and especially in Gaul. Still more decidedly than in
England had the invading Vikings in France attached themselves to the
national element, even in the second generation they had given up their
language; they discovered at the same time a form which reconciled the
membership in the kingdom, and the recognition of the common faith, with
provincial freedom. In France no native power successfully opposed and
checked the advancing Normans, such as that which the Danes had
encountered in England. On the contrary they exercised the greatest
influence over the foundation of a new dynasty. A system developed
itself over the whole realm, in which, both in the provincial
authorities and in the lower degrees of rank, the possession of land and
share in public office, feudalism and freedom, interpenetrated each
other, and made a common-weal which yet harmonised with all the
inclinations that lend charm and colouring to individual life. The old
migratory impulse and spirit of warlike enterprise set before itself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
religious aims also, which lent it a higher sanction; war for the
Church, and conquest (which meant for each man a personal occupation of
land) were combined in one. Starting from Normandy, where great warlike
families were formed that found no occupation at home (for these young
populations are wont to multiply quickest), North French love of war and
habits of war transplanted themselves to Spain and to Italy. How must it
have elevated their spirit of enterprise when in the latter country the
Papacy, which had just thrown off the supremacy of the emperor, and
entered on a new stage in the development of its power, made common
cause with their arms, and a practised Norman warrior, Robert Guiscard,
appeared as Duke of Apulia and Calabria 'by grace of God and of S. Peter
and, under his protection, of Sicily also in time to come'!<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
The Pope
gave him lands in fief, which had hitherto belonged to the Greek Empire,
and which the Germans had been unable to conquer; he promised, in
return, to defend the prerogatives of S. Peter. Between the hierarchy
which was striving to perfect its supremacy, and the warlike chivalry of
the 11th century, an alliance was formed like that once concluded with
the leaders of the Frankish host. The ideas were already stirring from
which proceeded the Crusades, the foundation of the Spanish kingdoms,
and the creation of the Latin Empire at Constantinople. In the princely
fiefs of the French Crown, and above all in Normandy, they seized on
men's minds. Chivalrous life and hierarchic institutions, dialectic and
poetry, continual war at home and ceaseless aspirations abroad, were
here fused into a living whole.</p>

<p>In the Germanic countries also this close alliance of hierarchy and
chivalry now sought to win influence, but here it met with a strenuous
resistance. In England, Edward the Confessor had tried to prepare the
way for it: Godwin and his house opposed it. And when the former named
the Norman Robert Archbishop of Canterbury, and the latter drove him
out, the English quarrels became connected with those of Rome; Stigand,
the archbishop put in by Godwin, received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span> his pallium from Pope
Benedict X, who had been elected in the old tumultuous manner once more
by the neighbouring Roman barons, but had to succumb to Hildebrand's
zeal for a regular election by the cardinals, on which the emancipation
of the Papacy depended. It seemed, then, intolerable at Rome that there
should be a primate of the English Church, connected by his Church
position with a phase of the supreme priesthood now condemned and
abolished: it is very intelligible that this priesthood in its present
form took up a hostile position towards the England of that time. In
this, moreover, it found an ally ready to act in Duke William of
Normandy, who wished to be regarded as the born champion of the
Anglo-Saxon dynasty, and as the natural successor to its rights. Once
already his father had collected a fleet to restore the exiled
Aethelings, and was only kept back from an invasion by unfavourable
weather. There had often since been rumours, that Edward had destined
Duke William to be his successor; men asserted that Harold had
previously recognised this right, and that in return William's daughter,
and a part of the land as an independent possession, had been promised
him.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
In his own position William had cleared the ground for himself
with a strong hand. He had beaten his feudal lord in the open field, and
thus not only recovered a frontier fortress lost during his minority,
but also strengthened the independence of the duchy. At the same time
William had vanquished his rebellious vassals in arms, banished them,
deprived them of their possessions, and got rid, with the Pope's
consent, of an archbishop who was allied with them. Death freed him from
another mighty opponent, the Duke of Brittany, who threatened him with a
great maritime expedition. It throws a certain light on his policy, to
see how he made himself master of the county of Maine in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span> 1062. On the
ground that Count Heribert, whom he had supported in his quarrel with
Anjou, had become his vassal and made him his heir,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
he overran
Maine, and put his adherents in possession of the fortresses which
commanded the land. However we may decide as to the details told us
about his relations to Edward and Harold, it seems undeniable that
William had received provisional promises from both&mdash;for Harold loved to
side with Edward. He was not the man to put up with their being broken.
The system, however, which through Harold's accession gained the upper
hand in England, was in itself hostile to the Norman one: and that a
king of England like the present might some day become dangerous to the
duke, amidst all the other hostilities which threatened him, is clear.
To these motives was now added the approbation of the Roman See. The
Pope's chief Council deliberated on the enterprise, above all did the
archdeacon of the Church, Hildebrand, declare himself in its favour. He
was reproached&mdash;then or at a later time&mdash;with being the author of
bloodshed; he declared that his conscience acquitted him, since he knew
well, that the higher William mounted, the more useful he would be to
the Church.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
Alexander II now sent the duke the banner of the Church.
As a few years before Robert Guiscard had become duke, so now a Norman
duke was to become king, in the service of the Church. The Normans were
still divided in their views as to the enterprise, but when this news
arrived, all opposition ceased, for in the service of S. Peter and the
Church men believed themselves secure of success; then lay and spiritual
vassals emulously armed ships and men; in the harbour of S. Valery,
which belonged to one of those who had been last gained over, the Count
of Ponthieu, the fleet and the troops gathered together.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
The Count
of Flanders, the duke's father-in-law, secretly favoured the enterprise;
another of his nearest relations, Count Odo of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>Champagne, brought up
his troops in person; Count Eustace of Boulogne armed, to avenge on
Godwin's house an affront he had once suffered at Dover; a number of
leading Breton counts and lords attached themselves to William in
opposition to their duke, who cherished wholly different projects. To
the lords and knights of North France were joined many of lower rank,
whose names show that they came from Gascony, Burgundy, the duchy of
France, or the neighbouring districts belonging to the German Empire. Of
their own free will they ranged themselves round William, to vindicate
the right which he claimed to the English crown, but each man naturally
entertained brilliant hopes also for himself. William is depicted as a
man of vast bodily strength, which none could surpass or weary out, with
a strong hardy frame, a cool head, an expression in his features which
exactly intimated the violence with which he followed up his enemies,
destroyed their states, and burnt their houses. Yet all was not
passionate desire in him. He honoured his mother, he was true to his
wife. Never did he undertake a quarrel without giving fair notice, and
certainly never without having well prepared for it beforehand. He knew
how to keep up a warlike spirit in his vassals: there were seen with him
only splendid men and able leaders; he kept strict discipline. So also
he had seized the moment for his enterprise, at which the political
relations of Europe were favourable to him. The two great realms, which
might otherwise have well interposed, the East Frank (or the
Roman-German) as well as the West Frank, were under kings not yet of
age: the guardianship of the latter lay with the Count of Flanders, who
thought he did enough in not standing openly by his son-in-law, of the
former with great bishops devoted heart and soul to the hierarchic
system.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
Harold, on the other hand, had no friend or ally, in North
or East, in South or in West. To encounter the combined efforts of a
great European coalition he had only himself and his Anglo-Saxons to
rely on. Harold is depicted as coming forth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span> perfect from the hands of
nature, without blemish from head to foot, personally brave before the
enemy, gentle among his own people, and endowed with natural eloquence.
His enemy's passion for, and knowledge of, war were not in him; the
taste of the Anglo-Saxons was directed more to peaceful enjoyments than
to ceaseless wars. At this moment too they were weakened by great losses
in the last bloody war; many of the most trustworthy and bravest had
fallen, others wavered in their fidelity; Harold had not been able to
put even the coasts in a state of defence; William landed without
resistance, to demand his crown from him. When reminded of his promise
Harold was believed to have answered in the very spirit of Anglo-Saxon
independence, that he had no right to make any such promise without the
consent of the Anglo-Saxon chiefs and people. And not to meet the
invading foe instantly at the sword's point would have seemed to him
disgraceful cowardice. And so William and Harold, the North French
knights and the national war-array of the Anglo-Saxons, encountered at
Hastings. Harold fell at the very beginning of the fight. The Normans,
according to their wont, knew how to separate their enemies by a
pretended flight, and then by a sudden return to surround and destroy
them in isolated bodies. It was the iron-clad, yet rapidly moving
cavalry, which decided the battle.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>William expected, now that his rival had fallen, to be recognised by the
Anglo-Saxons as their King. Instead of this the chiefs and the capital
raised Edgar the Aetheling, grandson of Edmund Ironsides, to the throne:
as though William would retire before a scion of the old West-Saxon
house, of which he professed to be the champion. He held firmly to the
transfer made to him by the last king without regard to any third
person, ratified as it was by the Roman See, and marched on the capital.</p>

<p>Edgar was a boy, and the magnates were at variance as to who should have
the authority to exercise guardianship over him. When William appeared
before the city, and threatened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span> the walls with his siege-machines, it
too lost courage. The embassy which it sent him was amazed at the
grandeur and splendour of his appearance, was convinced as to the right
which King Edward had transferred to him,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
and penetrated by the
danger which a resistance, in itself hopeless, would bring on the city.
Aldermen and people abandoned Edgar, and recognised William as King.
There is an old story, that the county of Kent, on capitulating, made
good conditions for itself. To the nobles also, who submitted by
degrees, similar terms may have been accorded, but their position was
almost entirely altered. We need notice only this one point. Their chief
right, which they exercised to a perhaps unauthorised extent, was that
of electing the King; they had now elected twice, but the first election
was annulled by defeat in the open field, the second by increasing
superiority in arms; they had to recognise the Conqueror, who claimed by
inheritance, as their King, whether they would or no. There is something
almost symbolic of the resulting state of things in the story of
William's coronation, which was now celebrated by the tomb of Edward the
Confessor at Westminster. For the first time the voices of the
Anglo-Saxons and the Normans were united to greet him as King, but the
discordant outcry of the two languages seemed a sign of conflict to the
troops gathered outside, and made the warlike fury, so hardly kept under
control, boil up again in them; they set the houses of London on fire.
Whilst all hurried from the church, the ceremony it is said was
completed by shuddering priests in the light of the flames: the new King
himself, who at other times did not know what fear was, trembled.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>By this coronation-acclaim, two constituent elements of the world, which
had been fundamentally at conflict with each other, became indissolubly
united.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
That against which the Anglo-Saxons had set themselves to guard with all
their strength during the last period, the inroad of the Norman-French
element into their Church and their State, was now accomplished in
fullest measure. William's maxim was, that all who had taken arms
against him and his right had forfeited their property; those who
escaped, and the heirs of those who had fallen, were deprived alike. In
a short time we find William's leading comrades in the war, as earls of
Hereford, Buckingham, Shrewsbury, Cornwall; his valiant brothers were
endowed with hundreds of fiefs; and when the insurrection which quickly
broke out led to new outlawries and new confiscations, all the counties
were filled with French knights. From Caen came over the blocks of
freestone to build castles and towers, by which they hoped to bridle the
towns and the country. It is an exaggeration to assume a complete
transfer of property from the one people to the other; among the tenants
in chief about half the names are still Anglo-Saxon. At first, those who
from any even accidental cause had not actually met William in arms were
left in possession of their lands, though without hereditary right:
later, after they had conducted themselves quietly for some time, this
too was given back to them. In the next century it excited surprise that
so many great properties should have remained in the hands of the
Anglo-Saxons.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
 It would have been altogether against William's plan,
to treat the Anglo-Saxons as having no rights. He wished to appear as
the rightful successor of the Anglo-Saxon kings: by their laws he would
abide, only adding the legal usages of the Normans to those of the
Danes, Mercians, and West Saxons; and it was not merely through his
will, but also by its higher form, and connexion with the ideas of the
century, that the Norman law gained the upper hand. But however much we
may deduct from the usual exaggerations, this fact remains, that the
change of ownership which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span> took place, like the change in the
constitution and the general state of things, was of enormous extent:
the military and judicial power passed entirely into the hands of the
victors in the war. And in the Church alterations no less thoroughgoing
ensued. Under the authority of Papal legates, the great office-holders
of the English Church, who had been opposed to the newly arisen
hierarchic system, were mercilessly deprived of their places. The King
was afterwards personally on tolerably good terms with Stigand, the
Archbishop of Canterbury, but was not inclined on his account to oppose
the Church. The archbishopric, and with it the primacy of England,
passed to the man in whom the union of the Church authority and
orthodoxy of that which we may call the especially hierarchic century
was most vividly represented, the man who had been the chief agent in
establishing the dogma of Transubstantiation, the great teacher of Bec,
Lanfranc. In most of the bishoprics and abbeys we find Normans of
kindred tendency. It was precisely in the enterprise against England
that the hierarchy concluded its compact with the hereditary feudal
state, which was all the more lasting in that they were both still in
process of formation.</p>

<p>In this way was England attached by the strongest ties to the Continent,
and to the new system of life and ecclesiastico-political constitution
which had then gained the upper hand in Latin Europe. Under the next
three successors of the Conqueror, none of whom enjoyed a completely
legal recognition, it sometimes appeared as though England would again
tear herself away from Normandy: such variances were not without
influence on home affairs: in the general relations of the country they
wrought no change at all. On the contrary, these were developed on a
still larger scale, owing to the complicated family connexions which so
peculiarly characterise that epoch. From the county of Anjou which, like
the dominion of the Capets, had been formed in the struggle against the
invasion of the Normans, a sovereign arose who had the right to rule the
Norman conquests, the son of the Conqueror's granddaughter, Henry
Plantagenet. He had become, though not without appeal to the sword,
which his father wielded powerfully on his behalf, master of Normandy,
and had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>n married Eleanor of Poitou, who brought him a great part of
South France: he then succeeded more by fair means than by force in
establishing his right to the throne of England. Henry was the first to
establish in France the power of the great vassals, by which the crown
was long in danger of being overthrown. The Kings of Castille and
Navarre submitted to his arbitration. And under a sovereign whose
grandfather had been King of Jerusalem, and one of the mightiest rulers
of that Western kingdom established in the East, the tendencies, which
had led so far, could not fail to extend themselves to the utmost in all
their spheres of action? The hierarchic and chivalrous spirit of
Continental Europe, which under the Normans had seized on England, was
much strengthened by the accession of the Plantagenets. It thus came to
pass that after the disastrous loss of Jerusalem, the knights of Anjou
and of Guienne, from Brittany (for Henry had added this province also to
his family possessions) and from Normandy, gathered together in London,
and took the Cross in company with the English. England formed a part of
the Plantagenet Empire&mdash;if we may apply this word to so anomalous a
state&mdash;and contributed to its extension, even though no interest of its
own was involved. But towards such a result the relations which this
alliance established between England and Southern Europe had long
tended. Not seldom was the military power of the provinces over the sea
employed for enterprises that aimed at the direct advantage of England
itself. Whether and when the German element without this influence would
have become master of the British group of islands none could say. The
English dominion over Ireland in particular is derived from Henry II,
and his alliance at that time with the Papacy; he crossed thither under
the Pope's authorisation: at the Pope's word the native kings did homage
to him as their lord.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
And the foreign-born Plantagenets struck
living root in England itself. As Henry II's mother was the daughter of
a princess descended from the West-Saxon house, he was hailed by the
natives as their lawfully-descended King; in accordance with Edward the
Confessor's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span> prophecy, that from the severed bough should spring up a
new tree: they traced his descent without scruple back to Wodan. This
King, moreover, has impressed his mark deeply on English life; to this
day justice is administered in England under forms established by him.</p>

<p>The will of destiny cannot be gainsaid. Just as Germany without its
connexion with Italy, so England without its connexion with France,
would never have been what it is. More than all, the great commonwealth
of the western nations, whose life pervades and determines the history
of each separate state, would never have come into existence. But on
this ground first, amidst continual warfare, was gradually accomplished
the formation of the nationalities. </p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class='centersm'><a name="BI_III_I" id="BI_III_I"></a>
THE CROWN IN CONFLICT WITH CHURCH AND NOBLES.</p>

<p>Highly as we may estimate the due appreciation and expression of those
objective ideas, which are bound up with the culture of the human race,
still the spiritual life of man is built up not so much on a devout and
docile receptivity of these ideas as on their free and subjective
recognition, which modifies while it accepts, and necessarily passes
through a phase of conflict and opposition.</p>

<p>In England the authority both of Church and State now came forward with
far more strength than before. The royal power was a continuation of the
sovereignty inherited from Anglo-Saxon times, but, leaning on its
continental resources, and supported by those who had taken part in the
Conquest, it developed itself much more durably. The clergy of the land
were far more closely and systematically bound to the Papacy; thus it
had become more learned and more active. The one sword helped the other;
just at this very time, the King and the Archbishop of Canterbury were
depicted as the two strong steers that drew the plough of England.</p>

<p>But yet, below all this there existed a powerful element of opposition.
After the new order of things had existed more than eighty years, among
a portion of the Anglo-Saxon population the design was started of
putting a violent end to it, of destroying at one blow all those
foreigners who seemed its representatives, just as the Danes had all
been murdered on one day.</p>

<p>It was an evil thought, and all the more atrocious because manifold ties
had been already gradually formed between the two populations. How could
they ever become fused into one nation if the one was always plotting
the destruct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>ion of the other?</p>

<p>It was not merely by alliances of blood and family, but even still more
by great common political and ecclesiastical interests that the English
nationality, which contains both elements, was founded. And, in truth,
the leading impulse towards it was that the conquerors, no less than the
conquered, felt themselves oppressed by the yoke which the two supreme
authorities laid on them, and hence both combined to oppose them. But
centuries elapsed before this could be effected. The first occasion for
it was given when the two authorities quarrelled with each other, and
alternately called on the population to give its voluntary aid.</p>

<p>For, as the authorities which represent the objective ideas are of
different origin, they have never in our Western Europe remained more
than a short time in complete harmony with each other. Each retains its
natural claim to be supreme, and not to endure the supremacy of the
other. The one has always more before its eyes the unity of the whole,
the other the needs and rights of the several kingdoms and states.
Amidst their antagonism European life has moulded itself and made
progress.</p>

<p>Close as their union was at the time of the Conquest of England, yet
even then their quarrel broke out. Though the Conqueror pledged himself
again to pay a tribute which the Anglo-Saxon kings had formerly charged
themselves with, and which had been long unpaid, yet this was not
sufficient for the Roman See: Gregory VII demanded to be recognised as
feudal lord of England. But this was not what William understood, when
he had allowed the papal banner to wave over the fleet that brought him
to England. It was not from the Pope's authorisation that he derived his
claim to the English crown, as if this had been merely transferred to
him by the Papal See, but from the Anglo-Saxon kings, as whose heir and
legal successor he wished to be regarded. He answered the Pope that he
could enter into no other relation to him than that in which his
predecessors in England had stood to previous popes.</p>

<p>For the first time the popes had to give up altogether the attempt to
make kings their feudal dependents; they attemp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>ted, however, an almost
deeper encroachment into the very heart of the royal power, when they
then formed the plan of severing the spiritual body corporate, which
already possessed the most extensive temporal privileges, from their
feudal obligation to the sovereigns. The English kings opposed them in
this also with resolution and success. Under the influence of the father
of scholasticism, Anselm of Canterbury, Primate of England, a
satisfactory agreement was arranged long before the Concordat was
obtained in Germany. In general there was little to fear, as long as the
Archbishop of Canterbury had a good understanding with the Crown; and
this was the case in the first half of the 12th century, if not on all
points, yet, at least on all leading questions. Far-reaching differences
did not appear until the higher ecclesiastics embraced the party of the
Papacy, which happened in England through Thomas Becket.</p>

<p class='sect'><a name="BI_III_II" id="BI_III_II"></a>Henry II and Becket.</p>

<p>It was precisely from him that this would have been least expected. He
had been the King's Chancellor, or if we may avail ourselves of a
somewhat remote equivalent expression, his most trusted cabinet
minister, and had as such, in both home and foreign affairs, rendered
the most valuable services. The introduction of scutage is attributed to
him, and he certainly had a large share in the acquisition of Brittany.
It was through the direct influence of the King that he was elected
archbishop.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
But from that hour he seemed to have become another man.
As he had hitherto rivalled the courtiers in splendour, pleasure, and
pomp, so would he now by strictness of life equal the sanctity of the
saints; as hitherto to the King, so did he now attach himself to the
interests of the Church. It might, so we may suppose, be some
satisfaction to his self-esteem, that he could now confront his stern
and mighty sovereign as Archbishop 'also by the grace of God,' for so he
designates himself in his letter to the King; or he might feel himself
bound to recover the possessi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>ons of his Church, which had been wrested
from it by the Crown or the high nobility. But, as spiritually-minded
men are moved more by universal ideas than by special interests, so for
Becket the determining impulse without doubt lay above all in the
sympathy which he devoted to the hierarchic movement in general.</p>

<p>Those were the times in which the attempt of the Emperor Frederic I to
call a council, and in it to decide on a contested papal election, had
created general excitement among the peoples and churches of Southern
Europe, which would only consent to be led by a pope independent of the
empire. Driven from Italy, Alexander III, the Pope rejected by the
Emperor, found a cordial reception in France; and here he now collected
on his side a papal council in opposition to the imperial one, in which
the cardinals, whose election the Emperor was trying to annul, and the
bishops of Spain and South Italy, and those of the collective Gaulish
dioceses (more than a hundred in number), and the English bishops also,
gathered around him, and laid the Pope elected by the Emperor under the
anathema. It was inevitable that the idea of the Church, as independent
of the temporal power, should here find its strongest expression. Some
canons were passed which prohibited the usurpation of ecclesiastical
property by the laity, and made it a crime in the bishops to allow
it.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>Thomas Becket was welcomed in this council with a seductive kindness;
but besides this, what is harder than to set oneself against the common
feeling of one's own order, when moderation already appears to be
apostasy? He returned to England filled with the ideas of hierarchic
independence; in preparing to carry it through, he necessarily brought
on the conflict which had hitherto been avoided.</p>

<p>The Plantagenet King, whose whole heart was in the work of securing the
obedience of the manifold provinces that had fallen to his lot; who
hastened ceaselessly from one to the other (when people thought him far
away in South<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span> France, he had already recrossed the sea to England),
ever occupied in extending his inherited power by institutions of a
legal and administrative nature, was not inclined to give way to the
Church in this attempt. He would neither make the election of the higher
clergy free, nor allow their excommunication to be valid without State
control; he not only maintained the right of the lay courts to try
ecclesiastics for heinous offences, which else often remained
unpunished; but, even in the sphere of spiritual jurisdiction, he
claimed to hear appeals in the last instance without regard to the Pope.
In all this the lay and spiritual nobility agreed with him; in a Council
at Clarendon they framed 'constitutions,' in which they declared these
rules to be the law of the realm, as it had always been observed, and
ought to be observed henceforth.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>Becket did not possess the inflexible obstinacy which distinguishes most
of the champions of the hierarchy. As the accordant voice of Europe
moved him to take up the hierarchic principles, so now the accordant
voice of his country's rulers made an impression on him: he listened to
the ecclesiastics who entreated him not to draw the King's displeasure
on them, and to the laymen, who prayed him not to bring on them the
necessity of executing it on the ecclesiastics: he virtually accepted
the Constitutions of Clarendon. But then again he could not prevail on
himself to observe them. Only when his vacillation endangered him
personally, so that he could expect nothing else to follow but a
condemnation by a new assembly of the royal court, did he come to a
decision. Then he took the hierarchic side resolutely; in contradiction
to the Constitutions, he appealed to the Pope. It is a remarkable day in
English history, that 14th October 1164, on which Thomas Becket, after
reading mass, appeared before the court without his archiepiscopal
dress, but cross in hand. He forbade the earl, who wished to announce
the judgment to him, to speak, since
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
no layman had power to sit in
judgment on his spiritual father;<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
he again put himself under the
protection of God and the Roman Church, and then passed from the court,
no man venturing to lay hands on him, still armed with his cross, to a
church close by, from whence he escaped to the Continent. By this he
brought into England the war of the two powers, which had already burst
into flame in Italy and Germany. The archbishop and primate rejected the
supreme judicial authority of the Curia Regis; only in the chief pontiff
at Rome did he recognise his rightful judge: by undertaking to bring
into full view the complete independence of the spiritual principle on
this ground also, he broke down that unity of authority, which had, been
hitherto maintained in the English realm, and entered into open war with
his King.</p>

<p>Henry II was, like most of the sovereigns of that age, above all things
a warrior; you could see by his stride that he spent his days on
horseback; and he was an indefatigable hunter. But yet he found time
besides for study; he took pleasure in solving, in the company of
scholars, the difficulties of the theologico-philosophical problems
which then largely occupied men's minds; there is no doubt that he also
fully understood these politico-ecclesiastical questions. He was by no
means a good husband, rather the contrary, but, in other things, he
could control himself; he was moderate in eating and drinking. Success
did not make him overweening, but all the more prudent:<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
ill-success
found him resolute; yet it was remarked that he was more severe in
success, milder in adversity. If contradicted, he showed all the
excitability of the Southern French nature; he passed from promises to
threats, from flatteries to outbursts of wrath, until he met with
compliance. His administration at home witnesses to a noble conception
of his mission and to a practical understanding; from his lion-like
visage shone forth a pair of quiet eyes, but how suddenly did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span> they
flame up with wild fire, if the passion was roused that slumbered in the
depths of his soul! It was the passion of unlimited power; an ambition
for which, as he once said, the world appeared to be too small. He never
forgave an opponent; he never reconciled himself with an enemy or took
him again into favour.</p>

<p>He would of himself have been much inclined to abandon Alexander III,
and attach himself to the Pope set up by the Emperor: his ambassadors
took part in a German diet at which the most extreme steps were approved
of. But Henry was not sufficiently master of his clergy nor, above all,
of his people for this; the solemn curse of Thomas Becket wrought on men
from far away. Was there really any foundation for what men then said,
that the King thought it better that his foe should be in the country
rather than out of it? An apparent reconciliation was brought about,
which, however, left the main questions undecided, each side only
consenting generally to a peace with the other. Becket did not allow
himself to be hindered by it, on his return to England, from
excommunicating leading ecclesiastics who had supported the King's
party. But at this Henry's deep-seated wrath awoke. Beset by the exiles
with cries for protection, he let the complaint escape him in the
presence of his knights, that among so many to whom he had shown favour
there was not one who had courage enough to avenge the insults offered
to him.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
As opposed to the Church sympathies which through the clergy
wrought on all people, the temporal state was mainly kept together by
the reciprocal relations of the feudal lord and sovereign to his vassals
and knights, and of them to him: to spiritual reverence was opposed
personal devotion. But these feelings, too, as they have their
justification, so they have their moral limitations; they are as capable
of exaggeration and excess as all others. Enflamed by the King's words
which seemed to touch the honour of knighthood, four of his knights
hastened to Canterbury, and sought out the man, who dared to bid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>the
King defiance in his own kingdom; as Becket refused to recall the
excommunication, they murdered him horribly in the cathedral. When
required to obey the King, Becket was wont to reserve the rights of the
Church and the priesthood; for this reservation he died.</p>

<p>Henry II by calling forth, intentionally or not, this brutal act of
violence in the ecclesiastical strife, drew on himself the catastrophe
of his life.</p>

<p>By Becket's murder the ideas of Church independence gained what was yet
wanting to them, a martyr: his death was more advantageous to them than
his life could ever have been. The belief that the victim wrought
miracles, which were ascribed to him in increasing measure, at first
slight, then more and more surprising ones, viz. cures of incurable
diseases,&mdash;who does not know the resistless nature of this illusion,
bound up as it is with the nearest needs of man in every form?&mdash;made him
the idol of England. Henry II had to live to see the man who had refused
him the old accustomed obedience, reverenced among his people with
almost divine honours as one of the greatest saints that had ever lived.
The great Hohenstaufen in the unsuccessful struggle with the Papacy was
at last brought to declare that all he had hitherto done rested on an
error; and in like manner, but one far more humiliating and painful,
Henry II had to do penance, and receive the discipline of the scourge,
at the tomb of the man who had been murdered by his loyal subjects. On a
hasty glance it seems as though his Constitutions were established, but
a more accurate inquiry shows that the articles which displeased the
Pope were left out. The hierarchic ideas gained the day in England also.</p>

<p>It was precisely the Church quarrel that fed the discords which broke
out in the King's own house. His eldest son found a pretence for his
revolt, and essentially promoted it, by alleging that the murderers of
the glorious martyr were unpunished; he on his side promised the clergy
to make good all existing injuries, since what belonged to the Church
should not serve man's ostentation. The example of the elder wrought on
the younger sons too, who, to withstand their father, recognised the
supremacy <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
of the King of France. Henry's last years were filled with
depression, and even with despair; when dying he was believed to have
bequeathed his curse to his children. In the cloisters his death was
ascribed to the intercession and merits of S. Thomas.</p>

<p>For with the acceptance of the hierarchic ideas the prestige of their
martyr grew day by day. In the crusade of 1189 men saw him appear in
dreams, and declare that he was appointed to protect the fleet, to calm
the storms.</p>

<p>It was under these auspices that the chivalry of the Plantagenet realm
took part in the Third Crusade: King Richard (in whom the ideas of
Church and Chivalry attained their highest splendour) at their head gave
back to the already lost kingdom of Jerusalem, in despite of a very
powerful foe, a certain amount of stability: as he served the hierarchic
views with all his power, there was no question under him as to any
dispute between Church and State. But this power itself could not be
increased owing to his absence. Whilst he fought for the Church far
away, elements of resistance were stirring in his realm which had been
there long ago, and soon after his death came to the most violent
outbreak.</p>

<p class="sect"><a name="BI_III_III" id="BI_III_III"></a>John Lackland and Magna Charta.</p>

<p>Despite all the community of interests between the sovereigns of the
Conquest and their vassals, grounds of hostility between them had never
been altogether wanting. The Conqueror's sons had to make concessions to
the great lords, because their succession was not secure; they needed a
voluntary recognition, the price of which consisted in a relaxation of
the harsh laws with which the monarchy had at first fettered every
department of life. But when the great nobles had managed, or decided,
contests for the throne, Were they likely to feel bound unconditionally
to obey the man whom they had raised? Besides Henry II in his
ecclesiastical quarrel needed the consent of his vassals; his
court-Assemblies were no longer confined to proclamations of ordinances
from the one side only; consultations were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span> held, leading to decisions
that concerned them all.</p>

<p>But what is now surprising is the fact, that even the associates in the
Conquest, and much more their descendants, claimed the rights which the
Anglo-Saxon magnates had once possessed. They, too, appealed incessantly
to the <i>Laga</i>, the laws of Edward the Confessor, by which was meant the
collection of old legal customs, the observation of which had been
promised from the first. Following the precedent of their kings, the
families that had risen through the Conquest regarded themselves as the
heirs of the fallen Anglo-Saxon chiefs, into whose place they had
stepped. The rights of the old Witan and of the vassals of the new
feudal state became fused together.</p>

<p>We must now lay greater weight than is commonly done on the incidents
that occurred during King Richard's absence. He had entrusted the
administration of the realm to a man of low origin, William, bishop of
Ely, who carried it on with great energy, and not without the pomp and
splendour, which grace authority, but arouse jealousy. Hence lay and
spiritual chiefs combined against him: with Earl John, the brother of
the absent King, at their head, they banished the hated bishop by the
strong hand, and of their own authority set another in his place. The
city of London, which had been already allowed the election of its own
magistrates by Henry II, had then formed a so-called <i>Communia</i> after
the pattern of the Flemish and North French towns; bishops, earls, and
barons, swore to support the city in it.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>These first attempts at an opposition by the estates obtained fresh
weight when on Richard's death a contest again arose about the
succession. Earl John claimed it for himself, but Arthur, an elder
brother's son, seemed to have a better right, and had been moreover
recognised at once in the South French provinces. The English nobles
fortified their castles, and for some time assumed an almost threatening
position; they only acknowledged John on the assurance that each and all
should have their rights.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
John's possession of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>crown was
therefore derived not merely from right of inheritance, but also from
their election.</p>

<p>A strong territorial confederacy had thus gradually grown up,
confronting the royal power with a claim to independent rights; events
now happened that roused it into full life.</p>

<p>King John incurred the suspicion of having murdered Arthur, who had
fallen into his hands, to rid himself of his claims; he was accused of
it by the peers of France, and pronounced guilty; on which the
Plantagenet provinces which were fiefs of the French crown went over to
the King of France at the first attack. The English nobility would at
least not fight for a sovereign on whom such a heinous suspicion lay: on
another pretence it abandoned him.</p>

<p>But then broke out a new quarrel with the Church. The most powerful
pontiff that ever sat in the Roman See, Innocent III, thought good to
decide a disputed election at Canterbury by passing over both
candidates, including the King's, and caused the election of, or rather
himself named, one of his friends from the great school at Paris,
Stephen Langton. As King John did not acknowledge him, Innocent laid
England under an Interdict.</p>

<p>Alike careless and cruel, naturally hasty and untrustworthy, of doubtful
birthright, and now rejected by the Church, John must have rather
expected resistance than support from the great men of the realm. He
tried to assure himself of those he suspected by taking hostages from
their families; he confiscated the property of the ecclesiastics who
complied with the Pope's orders, and took it under his own management;
he employed every means which the still unlimited extent of the supreme
authority allowed, to obtain money and men; powerfully and successfully
he used the sword. But in the long run he could not maintain himself by
these means. When a revolt broke out in Wales at the open instigation of
the Pope, and the King's vassals were summoned to put it down, even
among them a general discontent was perceptible; John had reason to
dread th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>at if he came near the enemy with such an army he might be
delivered into their hands or killed: he did not venture to carry out
the campaign. And meanwhile he saw himself threatened from abroad also.
King Philip Augustus of France armed, to attack his old opponent at home
(whom he had already driven from in those provinces over which he
himself was feudal sovereign), and to carry out the Pope's
excommunication against him. He boasted, probably with good grounds, of
having the English barons' letters and seals, promising that they would
join him. He would have restored all the fugitives and exiles; the
Church element would have raised itself all the more strongly, in
proportion to its previous depression; a general revolt would have
accompanied his attack, the English government according to all
appearance would have been lost.</p>

<p>King John knew this well: to avoid immediate ruin he seized on a means
of escape which was completely unexpected, but quite decisive&mdash;he gave
over his kingdom in vassalage to the Pope.</p>

<p>What William I had so expressly rejected was now accepted in a moment of
extreme pressure, from which such a step was the only means of escape.
The moment the Pope was recognised as feudal lord of England, not only
must his hostility cease, but he would be bound to take the realm under
his protection. He now forbade the King of France, whom he had before
urged on to its conquest, to carry out the invasion, which was already
prepared.</p>

<p>It appears as if the barons had originally agreed with the King's
proceeding, although they did not entirely approve its form. They
maintained that they had risen up for the Church's rights,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
and saw
in the Pope a natural ally. They thought to gain their own purpose all
the more surely now that Stephen Langton received the see of Canterbury,
a man who, while he represented the Papal authority, at the same time
zealously made their interests his own. At the very m<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>oment when the
archbishop absolved the King from the excommunication, he made him swear
that he would restore the good laws, especially those of King Edward,
and would do all according to the legal decisions of his courts. It may
be regarded as the first time that a Norman-Plantagenet king's
administration was acted on by an obligatory engagement, when King John,
on the point of taking the field against some barons whom he regarded as
rebels, was hindered by the archbishop who reminded him that he would
thus be breaking his last oath, which bound him to take judicial
proceedings. The tradition that a forgotten charter of Henry I was
produced by the archbishop (who was certainly, as his writings show, a
scholar of research), and recognised as a legal document which gave them
a firm footing, may admit of some doubt; there is no doubt that it was
Stephen Langton who gathered around him the great nobles and bound them
by a mutual engagement, to defend, even at the risk of life, the old
liberties and rights which they derived from Anglo-Saxon times.</p>

<p>It was, in fact, of considerable importance that the primate, on whose
co-operation with the King the Norman state originally rested, united
himself in this matter as closely as possible with the nobles; among all
alike, without regard to their origin, whether from France or from
England, had arisen the wish to limit the crown, as it had been limited
in the Anglo-Saxon period.</p>

<p>Here, however, they had to discover that the Pope was minded to protect
the King, his vassal, not only against attacks from abroad, but also
against movements at home. The engagements which the barons had formed,
when he released them from their oath of fidelity to the King, he now
declared to be invalid and void. The legate in England reported
unfavourably on their proceedings, and it was seen that he was
intimately allied with the King. The war was still raging on the
continent, and the King had been again defeated, at Bouvines, July 27,
1214; he had returned disheartened, but not without bodies of
mercenaries, both horse and foot, which excited anxiety in the allied
nobles. This feeling was strengthened by the fact that, after the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span> death
of a chancellor connected with them by family, and on good terms with
them, he raised a foreigner, Peter des Roches, to that dignity, and it
was believed that this foreigner would lend a hand to any attempt at
restoring the previous state of things. Acts of violence of the old
sort, and the King's lusts, which brought dishonour into their families,
added to their indignation. In short, the barons, far from breaking up
their alliance, confirmed it with new oaths. While they pressed the King
to accept the demands which they laid before him, they sent one of the
chief of their number, Eustace de Vescy, to Rome, to win the Pope to
their cause, by reminding him of the gratitude due to them for their
services in the cause of the Church. As lord of England, for they did
not hesitate to designate him as such, he might admonish King John, and,
if necessary, force him to restore unimpaired the old rights guaranteed
them by the charters of earlier Kings.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>But not so did Innocent understand his right of supreme lordship in
England; he did not side with those who had helped to win the victory
for him over the King, but with the King himself, to whose sudden
decision he owed its fruits&mdash;the acknowledgment of his feudal
superiority. He blamed the archbishop for concealing the movements of
the barons from him, and for having, perhaps, even encouraged them,
though knowing their pernicious nature: with what view was he stirring
questions of which no mention had been made either under the King's
father or brother? He censured the barons for refusing the scutage,
which had been paid from old times, and for their threat of proceeding
sword in hand. He repeated his command to them to break up their
confederacy, under threat of excommunication.</p>

<p>As one step lower the primate and nobles, so in the highest sphere
Innocent and John were in alliance. The Papacy, then in possession of
supremacy over the world, made common cause with royalty. Would not the
nobles, some from reverence for the supreme Pontiff's authority, others
from <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
a sense of religious obligation, yield to this alliance? Such was
not their intention.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>The King proffered the barons an arbitration, the umpire to be the Pope,
or else an absolute reference of the whole matter to him, who then by
his apostolic power could settle what was right and lawful. They could
not possibly accept either the one or the other, after the known
declarations of the Pope. As they persevered in their hostile attitude,
the King called on the archbishop to carry out the instructions of a
Papal brief, and pronounce the barons excommunicated. Stephen Langton
answered that he knew better what was the true intention of the holy
father. The Pope's name this time remained quite powerless. Rather it
was preached in London that the highest spiritual power should not
encroach on temporal affairs; Peter, in the significant phrase of the
time, could not be Constantine as well.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
Only among the lower
citizens was there a party favourable to the King, but they were put
down at a blow by the great barons and the rich citizens. The capital
threw its whole weight on the side of the barons. They rose in arms and
formally renounced their allegiance to the King; they proclaimed war
against him under the name of 'the army of God.' Thus confronted by the
whole kingdom, in which there appeared to be only one opinion, the King
had no means of resistance remaining, no choice left.</p>

<p>He came down&mdash;15th June, 1215&mdash;from Windsor to the meadow at Runnymede,
where the barons lay encamped, and signed the articles laid before him,
happy enough in getting some of them softened. The Great Charter came
into being, truly the 'Magna Charta,' which throws not merely all
earlier, but also the later charters into the shade.</p>

<p>It is a document which, more than any other, links together the
different epochs of English history. With a renewal of the earliest
maxims of German personal freedom it combines a settlement of the rights
of the feudal Estates: on this <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>twofold basis has the proud edifice of
the English constitution been erected. Before all things the lay nobles
sought to secure themselves against the misuse of the King's authority
in his feudal capacity, and as bound up with the supreme jurisdiction;
but the rights of the Church and of the towns were also guaranteed. It
was especially by forced collections of extraordinary aids that King
John had harassed his Estates: since they could no longer put up with
this, and yet the crown could not dispense with extraordinary resources,
a solution was found by requiring that such aids should not be levied
except with the consent of the Great Council, which consisted of the
lords spiritual and temporal. They tried to set limits to the arbitrary
imprisonments that had been hitherto the order of the day, by definite
reference to the law of the land and the verdict of sworn men. But these
are just the weightiest points on which personal freedom and security of
property rest; and how to combine them with a strong government forms
the leading problem for all national constitutions.</p>

<p>Two other points in this document deserve notice. In other countries
also at this epoch emperors and kings made very comprehensive
concessions to the several Estates: the distinctive point in the case of
England is, that they were not made to each Estate separately, but to
all at the same time. While elsewhere each Estate was caring for itself,
here a common interest of all grew up, which bound them together for
ever. Further, the Charter was introduced in conscious opposition to the
supreme spiritual power also; the principles which lay at the very root
of popular freedom breathed an anti-Romish spirit.</p>

<p>Yet it was far from possible to regard them as being fully established.
There were also conditions contained in the Charter, by which the legal
and indispensable powers of the King's government were impaired: the
barons even formed a controlling power as against the King. It could not
be expected that King John, or any of his successors, would let this
pass quietly. And besides, was not the Pope able to do away with the
obligation of which he disapproved? We still possess the first draft of
the Charter, which presents considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
variations from the document
in its final form, among others the following. According to the draft
the King was to give an assurance that he would never obtain from the
Pope a revocation of the arrangements agreed on; the archbishop, the
bishops, and the Papal plenipotentiary, Master Pandulph, were to
guarantee this assurance. We see to what quarter the anxieties of the
nobles pointed, how they wished above all to obtain security against the
influences of the Papal See. Yet this they were not able to obtain.
There was no mention in the document either of the bishops or of Master
Pandulph; the King promised in general, not to obtain such a revocation
from any one; they avoided naming the Pope.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>In reality it made no difference, whatever might be promised or done in
this respect. Innocent III was not the man to accept quietly what had
taken place against his declared will, or to yield to accomplished
facts. On the authority of the words 'I have set thee over the nations
and over the kingdoms,' which seemed to him a sufficient basis for his
Paramount Right, he gave sentence rejecting the whole contents of the
Charter; he suspended Stephen Langton, excommunicated the barons and the
citizens of London, as the true authors of this perverse act, and
forbade the King under pain of excommunication to observe the Charter
which he had put forth.</p>

<p>And even without this King John had already armed, to annul by force of
arms all that he had promised. A war broke out which took a turn
especially dangerous to the kingdom, because the barons called the heir
of France to the English throne and did him homage. So little were the
feelings of nationality yet developed, that the barons fought out the
war against their King, supported by the presence and military Power of
a foreign prince. For the interests of the English crown it was perhaps
an advantage that King John died in the midst of the troubles, and his
rights passed to his son Henry, a child to whom his father's iniquity
could not be imputed.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
In his name a royalist party was formed by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
the joint action of Pembroke, the Marshal of the kingdom and the Papal
Legate, which at last won such advantages in the field, that the French
prince was induced to surrender his claim, which he himself hardly held
to be a good one&mdash;the English were designated as traitors by his
retinue,&mdash;and give back to the barons the homage they had pledged him.
But he did so only on the condition that not merely their possessions,
but also the lawful customs and liberties of the realm should be secured
to them.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
At a meeting between Henry III and the French prince at
Merton in Surrey, it was agreed to give Magna Charta a form, in which it
was deemed compatible with the monarchy. In this shape the article on
personal freedom occurs; on the other hand everything is left out that
could imply a power of control to be exercised against the King; the
need of a grant before levying scutage is also no longer mentioned. The
barons abandoned for the time their chief claims.</p>

<p>It is, properly speaking, this charter which was renewed in the ninth
year of Henry III as Magna Charta, and was afterwards repeatedly
confirmed. As we see, it did not include the right of approving taxes by
a vote.</p>

<p>Whether men's union in a State in general depends on an original
contract, is a question for political theorists, and to them we leave
its solution. On the other hand, however, it might well be maintained
that the English constitution, as it gradually shaped itself, assumed
the character of a contract. So much is already involved in the first
promises which William the Conqueror made at his entry into London and
in his agreement with the partisans of Harold. The same is true of the
assurances given by his sons, especially the second one: they were the
price of a very definite equivalent. More than any that had gone before
however does Magna Charta bear this character. The barons put forward
their demands: King John negociates about them, and at last sees himself
forced to accept them. It is true that he soon takes arms
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span> to free
himself from the obligation he has undertaken. It comes to a struggle,
in which, however, neither side decidedly gains the upper hand, and they
agree to a compromise. It is true the barons did not expressly stipulate
for the new charter when they submitted to John's son (for with John
himself they could certainly have never been reconciled), but yet it is
undeniable that without it their submission would never have taken
place, nor would peace have been concluded.</p>

<p>As, however, is generally the case, the agreement had in it the germs of
a further quarrel. The one side did not forget what it had lost, the
other what it had aimed at and failed to attain. Magna Charta does not
contain a final settlement, by which the sovereign's claims to obedience
were reconciled with the security of the vassals; it is less a contract
that has attained to full validity, than the outline of a contract, to
fill up which would yet require the struggles of centuries. </p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class='centersm'><a name="BI_IV" id="BI_IV"></a>
FOUNDATION OF THE PARLIAMENTARY CONSTITUTION.</p>

<p>There is a very accurate correspondence in this epoch also between the
general history of the Western world and events in England: these last
form but a part of the great victory of the hierarchy and its advance in
power, which marks the first half of the 13th century. By combining with
the vassals the Popes had overcome the monarchy, and had then in turn
overcome the vassals by combining with the monarchy and its endangered
rights. It must not be regarded as a mere title, an empty word, if the
Pope was acknowledged to be feudal Lord of England: his legates, Gualo,
Pandulph, Otho, and with them some native prelates, devoted to him
(above all that Peter des Roches, who, by his conduct when Bishop of
Winchester, through the mistrust awakened, incurred almost the chief
responsibility of the earlier troubles), spoke the decisive word in the
affairs of the kingdom and crushed their opponents. It was reported that
Innocent IV was heard to say, 'Is not the King of England my vassal, my
servant? At my nod he will imprison and punish.'<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
Under this
influence the best benefices in the kingdom were given away without
regard to the freedom of election or the rights of patrons, and in fact
mostly to foreigners. The Pope's exchequer drew its richest revenues
from England; there was no end to the exactions of its subordinate
agents, Master Martin, Master Marin, Peter Rubeo, and all the rest of
them. Even the King surrounded himself with foreigners. To his own
relations and to the relations of his Provençal wife fell the most
profitable places, and the advantages arising from his paramount feudal
rights; they too exercised much influence on public affairs, and that in
the interests of the Papal power, with which they were allied. Riotous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
movements occasionally took place against this system, but they were
suppressed: men suffered in silence as long as it was only the exercise
of rights once acknowledged. But now it happened that the Popes in their
war with the last of the Hohenstaufen, whom they had resolved to
destroy, proposed to employ the resources of England and in a very
different manner than before. They awoke Henry III's dynastic ambition
by promoting the elevation of his brother to be King of the Romans, and
destining his younger son Edmund for the crown of Naples and Sicily.
King Henry pledged himself in return to the heaviest money-payments. It
began to appear as if England were no longer a free kingdom, using its
resources for its own objects: the land and all its riches was at the
service of the Pope at Rome; the King was little more than a tool of the
hierarchy.</p>

<p>It was at this crisis that the Parliaments of England, if they did not
actually begin, yet first attained to a definite form and efficiency.</p>

<p>The opposition of the country to the ecclesiastico-temporal government
became most conspicuous in the year 1257, when Henry, happy beyond
measure in his son's being raised to royal rank by the Apostolic See,
presented his son to the Great Council of the nation, already wearing
the national costume of Naples, and named the sum, to the payment of
which he had pledged himself in return. The Estates at once refused
their consent to his accepting the crown, which they considered could
not be maintained owing to the untrustworthiness of the Italians, and of
the Romish See itself, and the distance of the country; the money-pledge
excited loud displeasure. Since they were required to redeem it, they
reasonably enough gave it to be understood that they ought to have been
consulted first. It was precisely the alliance of the Pope and the King
that they had long felt most bitterly; they said truly, England would by
such a joint action be as it were ground to dust between two millstones.
As, however, despite all remonstrances, the demands were persevered
with,&mdash;for the King had taken on himself the debts incurred by Pope
Alexander IV in the Neapolitan war, and the Pope had already
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span> referred
to England the bankers entrusted with the payments,&mdash;a storm of
opposition broke out, which led to what was equivalent to an overthrow
of the government. The King had to consent to the appointment of a
committee for reforming the realm, to be named in equal proportions by
himself and by the barons; from this, however, was selected a council of
fifteen members, in which the King's opponents had a decisive majority.
They put forth Statutes, at Oxford, which virtually stripped the King of
his power; he had to swear to them with a lighted taper in his hand. The
Pope without hesitation at once condemned these ordinances; King Louis
IX of France also, who was called in as arbiter, decided against them:
and some moderate men drew back from them: but among the rest the zeal
with which they held to them was thus only inflamed to greater violence.
They had the King in their power, and felt themselves strong enough to
impose their will on him as law.</p>

<p>Without doubt they had the opinion of the country on their side. For the
first time since the Conquest the insular spirit of England, which was
now shared even by the conquerors themselves, manifested itself in a
natural opposition to all foreign influence. The King's half-brothers
with their numerous dependents were driven out without mercy, their
castles occupied, their places given to the foremost Englishmen. The
Papal legate Guido, one of the most distinguished members of the Curia,
who himself became Pope at a later time, was forbidden to enter England.
Most foreigners, it mattered not of what station or nationality, were
forced to quit the realm: it went hard with those who could not speak
English. The leader of the barons, Simon de Montfort, was solemnly
declared Protector of the kingdom and people; he had in particular the
lower clergy, the natural leaders of the masses, on his side. When he
was put under the ban of the Church his followers retorted by assuming
the badge of the cross, since his cause appeared to them just and
holy.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
At this very juncture it was that the attempt was made to form a
Parliamentary Assembly corresponding to the meaning of that word.</p>

<p>The Statutes or Provisions of Oxford contain the first attempt to effect
this, by enacting that thrice every year the newly formed royal Council
should meet together with twelve men elected by the Commonalty of
England, and consult on the affairs of the kingdom.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
There is no
doubt that these twelve belonged to the nobles and were to represent
them: the decisive point lies in the fact that it was not a number of
nobles summoned by the King, but a committee of the Estates chosen by
themselves that was placed by the side of the Council. The Council and
the twelve persons elected formed for some years an association that
united the executive and legislative powers.</p>

<p>But this continued only as long as the King acquiesced in it. When he
had the courage to resist, it is true that in the first encounter which
ensued, he was himself taken prisoner: but his partisans were not
crushed by this; and soon after his wife, who had collected about her a
considerable body of mercenaries, in concert with the Pope and the King
of France, thought herself strong enough to invade England. Simon felt
that he needed a greater, in other words, a broader, basis of support.
And the design he then conceived has secured him an imperishable memory.
He summoned first of all representatives of the knights of the shires,
and directly afterwards representatives of the towns and the Cinque
Ports, to form a Parliament in conjunction with the nobles of the realm.
This was not an altogether new thing in the European world; we know that
in the Cortes of Aragon, as early as the 12th century, by the side of
the high nobility and the ecclesiastics there appeared also the Hidalgos
and the deputies of the Commons; and Simon de Montfort might well be
aware of this, since his father had been in so many ways connected with
Aragon. In England itself under King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span> John men had come very near it
without however carrying it through: not till afterwards did the
innovation appear a real necessity. In opposition to the one-sided power
exercised by the foreigners, nothing was so much insisted on in daily
talk and in the popular ballads as the propriety of calling the natives
of the land to counsel, since to them its laws were best known. This
justifiable wish met with adequate satisfaction now that the Commons
were summoned; the public feeling against the foreigners, on which Simon
de Montfort necessarily relied, thus found expression. The assembly
which he called together doubtless sympathised with his party views. As
he invited only those nobles to it who remained true to him (they were
not more than twenty-three in number), so he appears to have summoned
those only of the towns which adhered to him unconditionally. But the
arrangement involved more than was contemplated from his point of view.</p>

<p>Amid the storms he had called forth Simon de Montfort perished: the King
was freed, the royal authority re-established. A new Papal legate
entered London in the full splendour of his office, Cardinal Ottoboni;
Guido having meanwhile himself obtained the tiara, and using every means
to subdue the unbending spirits, from which danger even to the Church
was dreaded.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
Yet the old state of things was not restored: neither
the rule of foreigners, nor the absolute dependence on the Papal policy.
The later government of Henry III has a different character from the
earlier: the legate himself confirmed Magna Charta in the shape finally
accepted. It is not merely at the great national festivals that we find
representatives of the towns present, whom the King has summoned; it is
beyond a doubt that one of the most important statutes of the time was
passed with their consent.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
Yet regulations for the summons of
representatives from the towns were as little fixed by law
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
as those for
voting the taxes. It would by no means harmonise with the constitution
of Romano-German states, that organic institutions should come into full
force in mere antagonism to the highest authority. They must coincide
with the interests of that authority, as was the case in England under
Henry's warlike son Edward I.</p>

<p>Without doubt Edward, who once more revived in the East the reputation
of the Plantagenet Kings for personal valour, would have preferred to
fight there for the interests of Christendom, he even speaks of it in
his will; or else he would have wished to recover from the French crown
the lands which his father had inherited, and which had passed into
French possession; but neither the one nor the other was possible;
another object was assigned to his energy and his ambition, one more
befitting an English king: he undertook to unite the whole island under
his sceptre.</p>

<p>In Wales, the conquest of which had been so often attempted and so often
failed, there lived at this time Prince Llewellyn, whose personal
beauty, cunning, and high spirit fitted him to be a brilliant
representative of the old British nationality. The bards, reviving the
old prophecies, promised him the ancient crown of Brutus; but when he
ventured out of the mountains, he was overpowered and fell in a
hand-to-hand conflict. The English crown was not to fall to his lot, but
Edward transferred the title of Prince of Wales to his own son. The
great cross of the Welsh, the crown of Arthur, fell into his hands: he
no longer tolerated the bards: their age passed away with the Crusades.</p>

<p>From Wales Edward turned his arms against Scotland. There Columban had
in former days anointed as king a Scottish prince, who was also of
Keltic descent; how the German element nevertheless got the upper hand
not merely in the greatest part of the country, but also in the ruling
family, is the great problem of early Scottish history: a thoroughly
Germanic monarchy had arisen, but one which after it had once given a
home to the Anglo-Saxons who fled before the Normans, thought its honour
concerned in repelling all English influences. A disputed succession
gave Edward I an opportunity of reviving the claims of his predecessors
to the overlordship
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
of Scotland: he gave the Scotch a king, whom the
Scotch rejected simply because he was the English King's nominee. The
war, which sometimes seemed ended&mdash;there were times at which Edward
could regard himself as the Lord of all Albion,&mdash;ever blazed out again;
above all, the support the Scotch received from the King of France
brought about complications which filled all Western Europe with trouble
and war; but it was in the home politics of England that their effect
was destined to be greatest.</p>

<p>Compelled to make incessant efforts, which exhausted the resources of
the crown, Edward appealed to the voluntary assistance of his subjects.
He laid down to them the principle, that their common perils should be
met with their united strength, that what concerns all must also be
borne by all. In the war against Wales he had gathered together the
representatives of the counties and the towns, to hear his demands and
to act accordingly; chiefly to vote him subsidies. After the victory he
had called an assembly of nobles, knights, and towns, to take counsel
with them about the treatment of the captives and the country. Similarly
he drew together the representatives of the towns in order to decide the
affairs of Scotland. With especial emphasis did he call for their united
help against Philip the Fair of France, who thought to destroy the
English tongue from off the earth: knights and towns were pledged to
help in carrying out the resolutions thus adopted by common consent.</p>

<p>In spite of all this appealing to free participation in public matters,
Edward I did not refrain from the arbitrary imposition of taxes, and
those the most oppressive: the eighth, even the fifth part of men's
income. For the campaign in Flanders he summoned the under-tenants as
well as the tenants in chief. We find instances of arbitrary seizure of
whatever was necessary for the war.</p>

<p>King Edward excused this by his maxim that the interests of the land
must be defended with the resources of the land,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
but we can conceive
how, on the boundary line between two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span> different systems, acts of
violence, which combined the arbitrariness of the one with the
principles of the other, caused a general agitation. In the year 1297
the spiritual lords under their archbishop, as well as the temporal ones
(who denied the obligation to serve beyond the sea) under the Constable
and Marshal, set themselves energetically to oppose the King. The
people, which had the most to suffer from the arbitrary exactions, took
their side with cordial approval. They set forth all the grievances of
the country, and insisted on their immediate and final redress.</p>

<p>To avoid the pressure, the King had already quitted England, to carry on
his campaign in Flanders: the demand was laid before the Councillors
whom he had left behind as assessors to his son, who was named Regent.
They however were in great perplexity, partly from the trouble of this
agitation itself, but mainly from the revolt in Scotland which had
broken out in a formidable manner. William Walays, like one of those
Heyduck chiefs who rise in Turkey against the established order of
things, the right of which they do not recognise, had come down from the
hill country, at the head of the fugitives and exiles, a robber-patriot,
of gigantic bodily strength and innate talent for war. His successes
soon increased his band to the size of an army; he beat the English in a
pitched battle, and then swept over the borders into the English
territory. If the royal commissioners would oppose a strong resistance
to this inroad, they must needs ratify a provisional concession of the
demands brought forward. The King, who had meanwhile reached Flanders,
which the French had entered from two sides, could not possibly yield to
the Scottish movement&mdash;whether he wished to carry on the war or make a
truce: nothing therefore remained to him but to confirm the concessions
made by his councillors.</p>

<p>It is not absolutely certain how far these had gone; one word of
discussion may be allowed on the matter.</p>

<p>The historians of the time have maintained that the right of voting the
taxes was granted to the Estates, and in fact conjointly to the nobles
whether spiritual or temporal, and the representatives of the counties
and towns: the copy of a statute is extant, in which this is very
expressly stated.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
But since the statute does not exist in an
authentic shape, and is not to be found in the Rolls of the Realm, we
cannot safely base any conclusion on it. As to the date too at which it
may have been passed, our statements waver between the twenty-eighth and
the thirty-fourth year of Edward. On the other hand we find in the
collection of charters an undoubted charter of confirmation given at
Ghent and dated 5 November 1297, in which not merely are the Great
Charter of Henry III and the Forest Charter confirmed, but also some new
arrangements of much importance guaranteed, and confirmed by
ecclesiastico-judicial regulations.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
According to it the grants of
taxes and contributions which had been hitherto made to the King for his
wars were not to be regarded as binding for the future. He reserves only
the old customary taxes: to the higher clergy, the nobility, and the
commons of the land the assurance is given, that under no circumstances,
however pressing, should any tax or contribution or requisition&mdash;not
even the export duty on wool&mdash;be levied except by their common consent
and for the interests of all.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
In the Latin text all sounds more open
and less reserved: but even the words of the authentic document include
a very essential limitation of the prerogative of the crown, which
hitherto had alone exercised the right of estimating what the state
needed and of fixing the payments by this standard. The King was averse
at heart to the limitation even in this form. When he came back from
Flanders after concluding a truce with France, and army and people were
met together at York, to carry out a great campaign against Scotland, he
was pressed to confirm on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span> English soil the concessions which he had
granted on foreign ground.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
He held it advisable that the campaign
should be first carried through; four of his confidential friends swore
in his stead (since an oath in person was thought unbecoming to the
King), that, the campaign ended, the confirmation should not be wanting.
The enterprise was most successful, it led to a great victory over the
Scots, and it was the leaders of the English aristocracy who did the
best service there; nevertheless, when they met together next Lent
(1299) in London, the King strove to avoid an absolute promise: he
wished to expressly reserve the undefined 'rights of the crown.' But
this delay aroused a general storm: and as he was quite convinced that
he could not, under this condition, reckon on further support in the war
which still continued, he at last submitted to what was unavoidable, and
allowed his clause to drop.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>I do not know whether I am mistaken in ascribing to these concessions a
different character from that of the earlier ones. It was not a
sovereign defeated and reduced to the deepest humiliation who made them,
nor did the barons obtain articles which aimed at securing their own
direct supremacy: the concessions were the result of the war, which
could not be carried on with the existing means. When Edward I laid
stress on the necessity of greater common efforts, the counter-demand
which was made on him, and to which he yielded, merely implied that a
common resolution should be previously come to. His concessions included
a return for service already done, and a condition for future service.
It did not abase the royal authority; it brought into clear view the
unity of interests between the crown and the nation.</p>

<p>Another great crisis united them for the second time. As Edward led the
forces of England year by year across the Tweed, to compel the Scots to
acknowledge his overlordship by the edge of the sword, the Pope who
assumed himself to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
be the Suzerain of the kingdoms of the world,
Boniface VIII, met him with the assertion that Scotland belonged to the
Church of Rome, the King therefore was violating the rights of that
Church by his invasions. To confront the Pope, King Edward thought it
best, as did Philip the Fair of France about the same time, to call in
his Estates to his aid, since without them no answer to the claim was
possible. The Estates then in a long letter not merely maintain the
right of the English crown, but also reject the Pope's claim to decide
respecting it as arbiter, as incompatible with the royal dignity: even
if the King wished it, yet they would never lend a hand to anything so
unseemly and so unheard of.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
The King, without regard to the Pope,
continued his campaigns against Scotland with unabated energy.</p>

<p>It marks the character of Edward I that he nevertheless did not break
with the Papacy on this account; so too he still raised taxes that had
not been voted, and held Parliaments in the old form: when
representatives of the counties and towns were summoned it is not always
clear whether they were elected or named.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
Edward I could not free
himself from the habits of arbitrary rule and the old ideas connected
with them. But with all this it is still undeniable that under him the
monarchy took a far more national position than before; it no longer
stood in a hostile attitude as against the community of the land, but
belonged to it.</p>

<p>And his successors soon saw themselves forced to complete still further
the foundations of a new state of things, which had been thus laid.</p>

<p>Under Edward II the old ambition of the barons to take a preponderant
part in the government reappeared once more with the greatest violence.
The occasion was afforded by the weakness of this sovereign, who allowed
his favourite, the Gascon Gaveston, a disastrous influence on affairs.
Discontented with this, the King's nearest cousin, Thomas of Lancaster,
placed himself at the head of the great nobles, as indeed he was
believed to have sworn to his father in law<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span> (whose rich possessions
passed to him, and who feared a return of the foreign influences), that
he would adhere to the interest of the barons, which was also that of
the country. In the fourth year of his government Edward was obliged to
accept all the regulations made by a Committee of the Nobles called the
'Ordainers.'</p>

<p>Without advice of the nobles he was forbidden either to begin a war, or
to fill up high offices of State, or even to leave the country: the
officers of the crown were to be responsible to them. Gaveston had to
pay for his short possession of influence by death without mercy.</p>

<p>It was long before the King found men who had the courage to defend the
lawful authority of the crown. At last the two Hugh Despencers undertook
it: under their leadership the barons were defeated, and Thomas of
Lancaster in his turn paid for his enterprises with his life. For in
England, if anywhere, the assumption of power led inevitably to the
scaffold.</p>

<p>It is hardly needful to say that the regulations of the Ordainers were
now revoked. But must not some means be also thought of, to prevent
similar acts of violence for the future? It was deemed necessary to
declare even the form, under cover of which they had been ratified,
invalid for all time. And so an enactment was now made, in which the
first definite idea of the Parliamentary Monarchy becomes visible. It
was declared that never for the future should any ordinance affecting
the King's power and proceeding from his subjects be valid, but only
that should be law which was discussed, agreed on, and enacted in
Parliament by the King with the consent of the prelates, the earls and
barons, and the commonalty of the realm.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
For it was above all things
necessary to withdraw the legislative authority for ever from the
turbulent grandees. The monarchy opposed to them its alliance with the
commonalty of the realm, as it was expressed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
by the representatives of
the knights and the commons. Among the founders of the English
constitution these Hugh Despencers, through whom the legislative power
was first transferred to the united body of King Lords and Commons, take
a very important position.</p>

<p>This thought was however rather one left for the future to carry out,
than one which swayed or contented the English world at the time. Edward
II fell before a new attack of the revolted barons, with whom even his
wife was allied: he had to think it a piece of good fortune that, on the
ground of his own abdication, his son was acknowledged as his successor.
The latter however could only obtain real possession of the royal power
by overthrowing the faction to which his father had succumbed. While he
restored the memory of the two Despencers, who had been condemned and
executed by the barons, he also decided to carry on a Parliamentary
government; it is the first that existed in England.</p>

<p>For the general course of the development it is significant that the
rights of Parliament in relation to the voting of taxes, and now also to
legislation as a whole, were acknowledged before an appropriate form was
found for its consultations. In the first years of Edward III its four
constituent parts, prelates, barons, knights, and town deputies, held
their debates in four different assemblies; but gradually the two first
were fused into an Upper, the two last into a Second House, without any
definite law being laid down to that effect: the nature of things led to
the custom, the custom in course of time became law.</p>

<p>That which had been already preparing under the first Edward came under
the third for the first time into complete operation, viz. the
participation of the Estates in the management of foreign affairs and of
war.</p>

<p>In the year 1333 the Parliament advised the King to break the peace with
Scotland, which the barons had concluded of their own authority
according to their own views, not to put up with any more outrages, and
not merely to take back the lost border-fortress of Berwick, but to
force the Scots to acknowledge the supremacy of England.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
In the year 1337 and afterwards the Parliament more than once approved
the King's plan of asserting the claim he had through his mother on the
French throne by force of arms and through alliances with foreign
princes,<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
and promised to support him in it with their lives and
properties; it was all the more ready for this, as France had been
repeatedly threatening England with a new Conquest. In the year 1344 the
Peers, each in his own name, called on the King to cross the sea and not
let himself be hindered by any one, not even by the Pope, from appealing
to the judgment of God by battle. The clergy imposed on themselves a
three-years' tenth, the counties a fifteenth, the towns two tenths; the
great nobles followed him in person with their squires and horsemen,
without even alluding to their old remonstrances. So that splendid army
made its appearance in France, in which the weapons of the yeomen vied
with those of the knights, and which, thanks chiefly to the former, won
the victory of Cressy. Whilst the King made conquests over the French,
his heroic Queen repelled the Scotch. In these wars the now united
nation, which put forth all its strength, came for the first time to the
feeling of its power, to a position of its own in the world and to the
consciousness of it. The King of Scotland at that time, and the King of
France some years later, became prisoners in England.</p>

<p>A period followed in which England seemed to have obtained the supremacy
in Western Europe. The Scots purchased their King's freedom by a truce
which bound them to long and heavy payments, for which hostages were
given as a security. A peace was made with the French by which Guienne,
Gascony, Poitou, and such important towns as Rochelle and Calais were
surrendered to the English. The Prince of Wales, who took up his
residence at Bordeaux, mixed in the Spanish quarrels with the view of
uniting Biscay to his territories in South France. As the result of
these circumstances and of the well-calculated encouragement of Edward
III, we find that English commerce prospered immensely and, in emulous
alliance with that of Flanders, began to form another great centre for
the general commerce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
of the world. It was still chiefly in the hands of
foreigners, but the English made great profits by it. Their riches
gained them almost as much prestige in the world as their bravery.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
The more money-resources the towns possessed, and the more they could
and did support the King, the greater became their influence on the
affairs of the realm. No language could be more humble than that of
these 'poor and simple Commons,' when they address themselves to 'their
glorious and thrice gracious King and lord.'<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
But for all that their
representations are exceedingly comprehensive and pressing; their grants
are not to take effect, unless their grievances are redressed; they
never leave out of sight the interests of their staple; they assail the
exactions of the officials or the clergy with great zeal. The regard
paid to them gives the whole government a popular character.</p>

<p>On an attempt of the King to exercise the legislative power in his great
council, they remonstrated; they had no objection to the ordinances
themselves, but insisted that valid statutes could only proceed from the
lawfully assembled Parliament.</p>

<p>Now too the relations to the Papal See came again into consideration.
Seated at Avignon under the influence of the French crown, the Popes
were natural opponents of Edward III's claims and enterprises; they
sometimes thought of directing the censures of the Church against him.
On the other hand, the complaints in England against the encroachments
and pecuniary demands of the Curia were louder than ever, without
however coming to a rupture on these points. But at last Urban V renewed
the old claim to the vassalage of England; he demanded the feudal
tribute first paid by King John, and threatened King and kingdom, in
case they were not willing to pay it, with judicial proceedings.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
We know the earlier kings had seen in the connexion with Rome a last
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
resource against the demands of the Estates: on the King's side it
required some resolution to renounce it. But the very nature of the
Parliamentary government, as Edward III had settled it, involved a
disregard of these considerations for the future. It was before the
Parliament itself that he laid the Papal demands for their consent and
counsel. The Estates consulted separately: first the spiritual and lay
lords framed their resolution, then the town deputies assented to it.
The answer they gave the Pope was that King John's submission was
destitute of all validity, since it was against his coronation-oath, and
was made without the consent of the Estates; should the Pope try to
enforce satisfaction of his demand by legal process or in any other
manner, they would all&mdash;dukes earls barons and commons&mdash;oppose him with
their united force.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
The clergy only assented to the declaration of
invalidity; to threaten the holy father with their resistance, they
considered unbecoming. But the declaration of the lay Estates was in
itself sufficient for the purpose: the claim was never afterwards raised
again.</p>

<p>The Estates had often been obliged to contend against the King and the
Roman See at the same time; now the King was allied with them against
the Papacy. Now that the Parliamentary constitution was established in
its first stage, it is clear how much the union of the Crown and the
Estates in opposition to external influence had contributed to it. It
was destined however shortly to undergo yet other tests. </p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class='centersm'><a name="BI_V" id="BI_V"></a>
DEPOSITION OF RICHARD II. THE HOUSE OF LANCASTER.</p>

<p>England did not long maintain herself in the dominant position she then
occupied; the plan of extending her rule into Spain proved ruinous to
the Prince of Wales. Not merely was his protégé overpowered by the
French 'Free Companies,' which had gathered round his opponent: a
Castilian war-fleet succeeded in destroying the English one in sight of
the harbour of Rochelle. On this, their natural inclination towards the
King of France awoke in the nobles and towns of South France; without
great battles, merely by the revolt of vassals tired of his rule, Edward
III again lost all the territories conquered with such great glory,
except a few coast towns. Then a gloom settled down around the aged
conqueror. He saw his eldest son, who, though obliged to quit France, in
England enjoyed the fullest confidence and had every prospect of a great
future, sicken away and die. And he too experienced, what befalls so
many others, that misfortune abroad raised him up opponents at home. In
the increasing weakness of old age, which gave rise to many
well-grounded grievances, he could not maintain the independence of the
royal power, with the re-establishment of which he had begun his reign.
He was forced to receive into his Council men whom he did not like. He
was still able to effect thus much, that the succession to the kingdom
came to the son of the Prince of Wales, Richard II. But would he, a boy
of eleven, be able to take the helm of the proud ship? Men saw factions
arise that grouped themselves round the King's uncles, who were not
fully disposed to defend his authority.</p>

<p>The great question for English history now was, whether the
Parliamentary constitution, whilst it limited the King's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
prerogative,
would also give him security. For the Commons had been at last admitted
into the King's Council chiefly in order that they might withstand the
violence of the factions. The situation however was not without its
complications, for with the political movement one of yet wider aim was
connected.</p>

<p>When the kingdom was at the very height of its power there arose in a
college at Oxford the man who began that contest against the Papal
supremacy which has never since ceased. John Wiclif attached himself
first of all to the political movements of his time. One of his earliest
writings was directed against the feudal supremacy of the Popes over
England. He supported the Parliament's complaints of Romish Provisions
and exactions of money, with great learning and at great length. Had his
activity confined itself to these subjects, he would be hardly more
remembered than perhaps Marsilius of Padua. What gave him quite a
special significance was the fact that he brought into clear view the
contradiction between the ruling form of the Church and the original
documents of the Faith. From the claim of the Popes to be Christ's
representatives, he drew the conclusion that they ought also to observe
the Gospel which comes from the God-Man, follow His example, and give up
their worldly power.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
The leading Church dogma, that most closely
connected with the hierarchic system, the dogma of Transubstantiation,
he attacked as being one which equally contradicted Scripture and
Reason. He urges his proofs with the acuteness of a skilful Schoolman,
but throughout he shows a deep inner religious feeling. We may
distinguish in him two separate tendencies. His appeal to Scripture, his
attempt to make it accessible to the people, his treatment of dogmatic
and religious questions which he will allow to be decided only by
Revelation,&mdash;all this makes him an evangelic man, one of the chief
forerunners of the German Reformation. But, as he himself felt, his
strength lay rather in destruction than in construction. In asserting
the doctrine that the title to office
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
depends for its validity on
personal worth, that even the rule of temporal lords rests on the favour
in which they stand with God, and in raising subjects to be the judges
over their oppressive masters, he entered on a path like that which the
Taborites and the leaders of the peasants in Germany afterwards
took.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>And these were precisely the doctrines for which his scholars, who
traversed the land to make them known, found a well prepared soil in the
people of England. How could the rise of popular elements fail to call
forth a kindred effort also among the lower classes? The belief arose
that Nature intended all men to be equal. The country people spoke of
their primitive rights, traces of which were found in the memorials of
the Conqueror's times, and which had then been taken from them. When
now, instead of seeing these respected, they were subjected to new
impositions, and this with harshness and insolence, they rose in open
revolt. So overpowering was the attack which they directed against the
capital and the King's palace, that Richard II found himself forced to
grant them a charter which secured them personal freedom. Had they
contented themselves with this, they might have done best for themselves
and perhaps for the crown, but when they demanded yet further and more
extreme concessions, they roused against themselves the whole power of
the organised State, for which they were as yet no match. The Mayor of
London himself struck down with his dagger the leader of the bands, Wat
Tyler, because he seemed to threaten the King; the Bishop of Norwich was
not hindered by his spiritual character from levelling his lance against
the insurgents;<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
after which he accompanied the leaders, who were
taken and condemned to death, to the scaffold, with words of comfort; in
other places the lay nobles did their best. When therefore in the next
Parliament the King brought forward the proposal to declare the serfs
free by a united resolution,&mdash;for the p<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>revious charter that had been
wrung from him was considered invalid,&mdash;both Lords and Commons rejected
it, as tending to disinherit them and prove pernicious to the kingdom.</p>

<p>It is not to be supposed that a movement like this, which the lower
class of citizens in the towns had joined, just as in the German peasant
war, and which was mainly directed against the landed gentry, could be
stifled by one defeat: it continued to ferment uninterruptedly in men's
hearts.</p>

<p>Still less did the condemnation passed by Convocation on the deviations
from the teaching of the Church effect their suppression. On the basis
of Wiclif's doctrines grew up the sect of the Lollards, which condemned
the worship of images, pilgrimages, and other external church
ceremonies, designated the union of judicial authority with spiritual
office as unnatural&mdash;'hermaphroditism'&mdash;rejected excommunication with
abhorrence, and made secret and systematic war against the whole Church
establishment.</p>

<p>But further besides these feuds there was one within the State system
itself which now became most conspicuous.</p>

<p>In the midst of the general ferment how necessary had a strong and
resolute hand become! But Richard's government had shown itself somewhat
weak; by many it was suspected of having meant to turn the disturbances
to its own advantage. The commons, who mainly represented the lower
gentry and the upper citizens, abandoned him, and attached themselves to
the nobles, just as these revived their old jealousy against the crown.
For the almost inevitable result of success in suppressing a popular
agitation is to heighten the self-confidence of an aristocracy.
Impatient at being excluded from all share in the government, and
strengthened in his ambition by the military disasters of the last
years, the youngest of Richard's uncles, Thomas of Gloucester, put
himself at the head of the grandees, whose plans the commons, instead of
opposing, now on the contrary adopted as their own. The great questions
arose, which have so often since then convulsed the European world, as
to the relation of a Parliamentary assembly to the Monarchy, and their
respective rights.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
The first demand of the English Parliament was that the ministers of
State should be named by it, or at least should be responsible to it.
Much as this demand itself implies, yet even more extensive views were
behind. The Peers told the King plainly that if he would not rule
according to the common law and with their advice, it was competent for
them to depose him, with consent of the people, and to raise another of
the royal house to the throne;<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
they threatened him openly with the
fate of Edward II.</p>

<p>Richard could do nothing but submit. Eleven lords were appointed to
restore order in the country; Richard had to swear to carry out all they
should ordain (November 1386). There remained but one way by which to
oppose this open violence: the King collected the chief judges at
Nottingham, and laid the question before them, whether the Commission
now forced upon him did not contravene the royal power and his
prerogative. The judges were far from so interpreting the Constitution
of England as to allow that the King is unconditionally bound by the
commands of Parliament. They affirmed under their hand and seal that the
appointment of that Commission against the King's will contravened his
legal prerogative; those by whom he had been forced to accept it, and
who had revived the recollection of the statute against Edward II, they
declared to be guilty of high treason. But Parliament itself saw in this
sentence not a judgment but an intolerable outrage. At its next sitting
it summoned the judges before its tribunal, and in its turn declared
them to be themselves guilty of high treason. Chief Justice Tresilian
died a shameful death at Tyburn. The King lived to find yet harsher laws
laid upon him: his uncle Gloucester was more powerful than he was
himself.</p>

<p>He was not however disposed to bear this yoke for ever. He first freed
himself from the war with France, which tied his hands; by his marriage
with Charles VI's young daughter he sought to win that king over as an
ally on his own side;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
at home too he gained himself friends; when all
was prepared, he struck a sudden blow (July 1397), which no one would
have expected from him. He removed his leading opponents (above all his
uncle Gloucester, and Arundel Archbishop of Canterbury), banished them
or threw them into prison: then he succeeded in getting together a
Parliament in which his partisans had the upper hand. It moreover
completely adopted the ideas of the judges as to the Constitution; it
revoked the statutes which had been forced on the
King,<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
and gave
effect to the sentence of Nottingham. By making the King a very
considerable grant for his lifetime, it freed him from the necessity of
summoning it anew; he rose at once to a high pitch of self-confidence:
he was believed to have said that the laws of England consisted in his
word of mouth.</p>

<p>In England, just as in France at the same epoch, political opinions and
parties ebbed and flowed in ceaseless antagonism. Richard's success was
only momentary. He too, like so many of his ancestors, had incurred a
grievous suspicion; the crime laid to his charge was that his uncle, who
died in prison, had been murdered there by his command. Besides his
absolute rule was not free from arbitrary acts of many kinds; among the
great nobles each trembled for his own safety; the clergy, never on good
terms with Richard, were impatient at being deprived of their Primate,
who was to them 'the tower in the protecting bulwark of the Church.' In
the capital too men were against a rule which seemed to put an end to
popular influence; it needed only the return of an exile, the young
Henry of Lancaster (whom the King would not allow to take possession of
his inheritance by deputy, and who in conformity with the feeling of the
time broke his ban to do himself right); all men then deserted the King;
the nobles could now think of carrying out the threat which they had
once hurled against him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
Richard was compelled to call a Parliament, and at the moment it met to
pronounce his own abdication. The Parliament was not contented with
accepting this; it wished to put an end to all doubt for the future, and
to establish its own right for ever.</p>

<p>A long list of articles was drawn up, from which it was concluded that
the King had broken his coronation oath and forfeited his crown; the
assembled Estates, when severally and conjointly consulted, held them
sufficient to justify them in proceeding to the King's deposition. They
named Proctors, two for the clergy, two for the high nobility&mdash;one for
the earls and dukes, the other for the barons and bannerets, two for the
knights and commons&mdash;one for the Northern, the other for the Southern
counties. They sat as a court of justice before the vacant throne, with
the Chief Justice in their midst: then the first spiritual commissioner,
the Bishop of S. Asaph, rose, and in the place and name and under the
authority of the Estates of the realm announced the sentence of
deposition against the late King, and forbade all men to receive any
further commands from him. Some opposition was raised; it is said that
the Bishop of Carlisle very expressly denied the right of subjects to
sit in judgment on their hereditary
sovereign;<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
but how could this
have had any effect against the Parliament's claim which had been
formulated so long?</p>

<p>As the crown was now regarded as vacant, Henry of Lancaster arose,&mdash;in
the name of God, as he said, whilst he made the sign of the cross on his
forehead and breast,&mdash;to claim it for himself, in virtue of his birth
and the right which accrued to him through God and the help of his
friends. It was not properly speaking an election that now took place:
the spiritual and lay lords, as well as the other members of the
Parliament, were asked what their opinion of his claim was: the answer
of all was that the Duke should be their King. When, conducted by the
two archbishops, he ascended the vacant throne, he was greeted with the
joyous acclaim
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
of those assembled. The Archbishop of Canterbury made a
speech full of unction, the drift of which was, that henceforth it would
not be a child, such as the late sovereign had been, self-willed and
void of understanding, but a Man that would rule over them, in the full
maturity of his understanding, and resolved to do not so much his own
will as the will of God.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>Thus did the spiritual and lay nobility, in and with the Parliament,
make good their claim to dispose of the crown. They went to work against
Richard II with less reserve than against Edward II. In the latter case
the Queen had taken part in the movement; they had set the son in his
father's stead. But this time they did not wait for the actual
consummation of the King's marriage; they raised a prince to the throne
who had openly opposed him in the field, and was not even the next in
succession. For there were still the descendants of an elder brother
left, who according to English usage had a prior right. The Parliament
held itself competent to settle on its own authority even the succession
to the crown. It enacted that it should belong to the King's eldest son,
and after him to his male issue, and on their failure to his brothers
and their issue. The proposal formally to exclude succession in the
female line did not pass; but for a long while to come the actual
practice had that effect.</p>

<p>Besides the motives involved in the extension of the Power of the
Estates in and for itself there was yet another reason for such a
proceeding. And this arose out of the growth, and increasing urgency, of
the religious divisions. The Lollards preached, and taught in schools,
according to their views: in the year 1396 in a petition to Parliament
they traced all the moral evils and defects of the world to the fact
that the clergy were endowed with worldly goods, and showed the
advantage which would arise from the application of these to the service
of the state and the prosecution of
war.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
They seem to have flattered
themselves that by this they would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
win over the lay lords, but they
were completely mistaken. For these remarked on the contrary that their
own property had no better legal foundation than that of the
clergy,<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
and only attached themselves to the rights of the Church all the more
zealously.</p>

<p>That which would have been impossible under Richard II's vacillating
government, the first Lancaster now undertook: in full agreement with
the Estates he a few days after his accession announced to Convocation
that he purposed to destroy heretics and heresies to the best of his
power.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
In the next Parliament a statute was drawn up in which
relapsed heretics were condemned to the flames. And still more
remarkable than this mode of punishment, which was that of the
Church-law, is the regulation of the procedure in this statute. In
former times the sentence had been pronounced by the archbishop and the
collective clergy of the province, and the King's consent had to be
asked before it was executed. The decision was now committed to the
bishop and his commissary, and the sheriff was instructed to inflict the
punishment without further appeal, and to commit the guilty to the fire
on the high grounds in the country, that terror might strike all the
bystanders. It is clear how much the power of the bishops was thus
extended. Soon after, on the proposal of the lay lords, at whose head
the Prince of Wales is named, a further statute passed, in which to
spread the rumour that King Richard was yet alive, and to teach that the
prelates ought to be deprived of their worldly goods, are treated as
offences of equal magnitude and threatened with a similar punishment;
the object being alike in both,&mdash;to raise a tumult. And in fact, when
Henry V himself had ascended the throne, an outbreak did occur, in which
these causes co-operated. The Lollards were strengthened in their
resistance to the government of the house of Lancaster by the rumour
that their rightful King was yet alive. Henry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
V was obliged to crush
them in open battle, and then force them to remain quiet by a new
statute, which enacted the confiscation of their goods as
well.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
His alliance and friendship with the Emperor Sigismund was based on the
fact, that he regarded the Hussites as only the successors of the
Lollards.</p>

<p>This orthodox tendency was now moreover combined with a strict
Parliamentary government. Under the Lancasters there is no complaint as
to illegal taxes; they allowed the moneys voted by the Parliament to be
paid over to treasurers named by itself and accountable to it; that
which earlier Kings had always rejected as an affront, the claim of
Parliament to exercise a sort of supervision over the King's household,
the Lancasters admitted; the royal officers were bound by oath to
observe the statutes and the common law; the prerogative, hitherto
exercised by the Kings, of softening the severity of the statutes by
proclamations contravening their purpose was expressly abolished.</p>

<p>The Lancasters owed their rise to their alliance with the clergy and the
Parliament: a fact which determined the character and manner of their
government. The most manifold results might be expected, even beyond the
borders of England, from their having by this very alliance won for
themselves a great European position.</p>

<p>Nowhere was greater interest taken in Richard's fate than at the French
court. Louis Duke of Orleans, whose voice was generally decisive there,
once challenged the first Lancaster to a duel, and when he refused it
pressed him hard with war. That Owen Glendower could once more maintain
himself as Prince in Wales was entirely due to his French auxiliaries.
That we find Henry IV more secure of his throne in his later years than
in his earlier is a phenomenon the explanation of which we seek in vain
in English affairs alone: it results from the fact that his powerful
foe, Louis of Orleans, was murdered in the year 1407 at the instigation
of John Duke of Burgundy, and that then the quarrel of the two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span> parties,
which divided France, burst out with increased violence, and remained
long undecided. From the French there was no longer anything to fear:
they emulously sought the alliance of the highest power in England;
there even arose circumstances under which the Lancasters could think of
renewing the claims of Edward III, from whom they too were descended.</p>

<p>At the time that Henry V ascended the English throne, the Orleanists had
again gained the preponderance in France: they unfurled the Oriflamme
against the Duke of Burgundy, who was now in fact hard pressed. Henry
negociated with them both. But while the Orleanists made difficulties
about granting him the independent possession of the old English
provinces, Burgundy declared himself ready to acknowledge him as
King.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
The common interests moreover of home politics allied him with
this house.</p>

<p>Henry could reckon on the sympathies of a part of the population of
France, when he led the power of England across the sea. A successful
battle in which he destroyed the flower of the French nobility gave him
an undoubted superiority. The vengeance which the Orleanists wreaked
even under these circumstances on the Duke of Burgundy, who was now
murdered in his turn, brought the Burgundian party over completely to
his side, together with the greater part of the nation. Things went so
far that Charles VI of France decided to marry his daughter to the
victorious Lancaster and to acknowledge him, as his heir after his
death, as his representative during his life.</p>

<p>It was a very extraordinary position which Henry V now occupied. The two
great kingdoms, each of which by itself has earlier or later claimed to
sway the world, were (without being fused into one) to remain united for
ever under him and his successors. Philip the Good of Burgundy was bound
to him by ties of blood and by hostility to a common foe: as heir of
France Henry sat in the Parliament
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
by which the murderers of the last
duke, who were also the chief opponents of the new state of things, were
prosecuted. Another promising connexion was opened to him by the
marriage of the youngest of his brothers with Jaqueline of Holland and
Hainault, who possessed still more extensive hereditary claims. Henry
recommended the eldest to Queen Johanna of Naples to be adopted as her
son and heir. The King of Castile and the heir of Portugal were
descended from his father's sisters. The pedigrees of Southern and
Western Europe alike met in the house of Lancaster, the head of which
thus seemed to be the common head of all.</p>

<p>In England Henry did not neglect to guard the rights of the National
Church; but at the same time no one exerted himself more energetically
to close the schism: the solemn condemnation of Wiclif's doctrines by
the General Council of Constance served to vouch for his attitude in
religious matters: the English Church obtained in it a place among the
great National Churches.</p>

<p>Henry V found himself in the advantageous position of a potentate raised
to power by a usurpation for which he was not however personally
responsible. He could spare and reinstate Richard II's memory, as much
as in him lay, though he owed the crown to his overthrow. That he
furthered and advanced also in France the municipal and parliamentary
interests, which were his mainstay in England, procured him the
obedience which was there paid him, and a European influence. In his
moral character Henry ranks above most of the Plantagenets. He had no
favourites and let no unjust acts be imputed to him. He was stern
towards the great and careful for the common people; at his first word
men could tell what they had to expect from him. The French were
frightened at the keenness of his expression, but they reverenced his
high spirit, his bravery and truthfulness. 'He transacts all his affairs
himself; he considers them well before he undertakes them; he never does
anything fruitlessly. He is free from excesses, and truthful: he never
makes himself too familiar. On his face are visible dignity and supreme
power.'<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>
He possessed in full measure the bold impulses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
of his ancestors, their attention to the general affairs of Western
Christendom. In the war with the Lollards he was once wounded; that he
recovered from his wound was designated as the work of divine
Providence, which had destined him to be the conqueror of the Holy Land.
He informed himself about its state as it was then constituted under the
Mameluke rule: a Chronicle of Jerusalem and a History of Godfrey of
Bouillon were two of the books he loved most to read. And without doubt
such an undertaking would have been the true means, if any such means
were possible, of uniting more closely, by common undertakings successes
and interests, the realms already bound together under one sceptre. The
Ottomans had not yet extended themselves in the East with their full
force: something might yet have been effected there; for the King of
France and England, who was yet young in years, a great future seemed to
be at hand.</p>

<p>Sometimes it seems as though fortune were specially making a mock of
man's frailty. In this fulness of power and of expectations, Henry V was
attacked by a disease which men did not yet know how to cure and to
which he succumbed. His heir was a boy, nine months old.</p>

<p>Of the two surviving brothers of the deceased King, the younger ruled
England under the already established predominance of the Estates of the
Realm, while the elder governed France with an increased participation
on the part of the Estates: their efforts could only be directed towards
preserving these kingdoms for their nephew Henry VI. We might almost
wonder that this succeeded so well for a time: in the long run it was
impossible. The feeling of French nationality, which had already met the
victor himself with secret warnings, found its most wonderful expression
in the Maid who revived in the French their old attachment to their
native King and his divine right; the English, when she fell into their
hands, with ungenerous hate inflicted on her the punishment of the
Lollards: but the Valois King had already gained a firm footing. It was
Charles VII who understood how to appease
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
the enmity of Burgundy, and
in unison with the great men of his kingdom to give his power a peculiar
organisation corresponding to its character, so that he was able to
oppose to the English troops better armed than their own, and make the
restoration of a firm peace even desirable for them. But this reacted on
England in two ways. The government, which was inclined for peace, fell
into as bitter a quarrel as any that had hitherto taken place with the
national bodies politic, which either did not recognise this necessity,
or attributed the disasters incurred to bad management. The man most
trusted by the King fell a victim to the public hate. But, besides this,
there arose&mdash;awakened by these events and in a certain analogy with what
happened in France&mdash;the recollection of the rights which had been set
aside by the accession of the house of Lancaster. Their representative,
Richard Duke of York, had hitherto kept quiet; for he was fully
convinced that a right cannot perish merely because it lies dormant.
Cautiously and step by step, while letting others run the first risk, he
at last came forward openly with his claim to the crown. Great was the
astonishment of Henry VI, who as far as his memory reached had been
regarded as King, to find his right to the highest dignity doubted and
denied. But such was now the case. The nation was split into two
parties, one of which held fast to the monarchy established by the
Parliament, while the other wished to recur to the principle of
legitimate succession then violated. Not that political conviction was
the leading motive for their quarrel. First of all we find that the
opponents of the government&mdash;though themselves of Parliamentary
views&mdash;rallied round the banners of the hitherto forgotten right of
birth. Every man fought, less for the prince whose device he bore, the
red or the white rose, than for his own share in the enjoyment of
political power. On both sides there arose chiefs of almost independent
power, who clad their partisans in their own colours, at whose call
those partisans were ready any moment to take arms: they appointed the
sheriffs in the counties and were lords of the land. But when blood had
once been shed, no reconciliation of the parties was possible. Ha, cried
the victor to the man who begged for mercy, thy father
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span> slew mine, thou
must die by my hand. In vain did men turn to the judges: for the
statutes contradicted each other, and they could no longer decide where
the right lay. From the Parliaments no solution of these questions could
be expected; each served the victorious party, whose summons it obeyed,
and condemned its opponent. As the resources on each side were tolerably
equal, even the battles were not decisive: the result depended less upon
real superiority than on accidental desertions or accessions, and most
largely on foreign help. After the English had failed, during the
antagonism of Valois and Burgundy, in establishing their supremacy on
the Continent, the quarrel&mdash;quieted for a moment&mdash;which broke out again
between Louis XI and Charles the Bold in the most violent manner,
reacted on them with all the more vehemence. King Louis would not endure
that a good understanding should exist between Edward IV and Duke
Charles, to whom Edward had married his sister: he drew the man who had
hitherto done the most for the Yorkist interests, the Earl of Warwick,
over to his own side; and scarcely had the latter appeared in England
when Edward IV was forced to fly and Henry VI was reinstated. Louis had
prepared church-thanksgivings to God for having given the English a king
of the blood of France and a friend to that country. But meanwhile
Edward was helped by Charles the Bold, to whom he had fled, though not
openly in arms, yet with ships which he hired for him, with considerable
sums of money, and even with troops which he allowed to join
him.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>
To these, his Flemish and Easterling troops, it was chiefly attributed that
Edward gained the upper hand in the field and recovered his throne. But
what a state of things was this! The glorious crown of the Plantagenets,
who a little while before strove for the supremacy of the world, was
now&mdash;stained with blood and powerless as it was&mdash;tossed to and fro
between the rival parties.</p>

<p class='center'><br />ATTEMPTS TO CONSOLIDATE THE KINGDOM INDEPENDENTLY IN ITS TEMPORAL AND
SPIRITUAL RELATIONS.
</p>

<p>We may regard it as the chief result of the Norman-Plantagenet rule,
that England became completely a member of the Romano-German family of
nations which formed the Western world. In however many ways the
invading nobility had mingled with the native houses, it yet held fast
to its ancient language; even now it is part of the ambition of the
great families to trace their pedigree from the Conquerors. Attempts had
been made, sometimes of a more political, sometimes of a more doctrinal
nature, to break loose from the hierarchy, which prevailed throughout
these nations; but they had only increased its strength; the native
clergy saw that its safety lay in the strictest adherence to the maxims
of the Universal Church. Similarly the character of the Estates in
England was akin to that of those in North France and especially in the
Netherlands; on this rests the sympathy which the enterprises of Edward
III and Henry V met with; for it was indeed the feeling of these
centuries, that the members of any one of the three Estates felt
themselves quite as closely bound to the members of the same Estate in
other lands as to their own countrymen of the other Estates. There was
but one Church, one Science, one Art in Europe: one and the same mental
horizon enclosed the different peoples: a romance and a poetry varying
in form yet of closely kindred nature was the common possession of all.
The common life of Europe flowed also in the veins of England: an
indestructible foundation for culture and progressive civilisation was
laid. But we saw to what point matters had come notwithstanding, as
regards the durability of its internal system and its power. The
Plantagenets had extended the rule of England over Scotland and Ireland:
in the latter it still subsisted, but only within the narrow limits of
the Border Pale; in the former it was altogether overthrown. The best
result that had been effected in home politics, the attempt to unite the
Powers of the country in Parliament had, after a short and brilliant
success, led to the deepest disorder by disregarding the rights of
birth. The degraded crown above all had thus become the prize of battle
for Pretenders allied with France or Burgundy. But it could not possibly
remain thus. The time was come to give the English realm an independent
position and internal order corresponding at once to its insular
situation and to the degree of culture it had attained.</p>

<p>The first who attempted this with some success was Edward IV, of the
house of York, who in the war of the Roses had remained master of the
field.</p>

<p>But everywhere there began once more an era of autocratic princes. </p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class='centersm'><a name="BII_I" id="BII_I"></a>
RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SUPREME POWER.</p>

<p>Edward IV was a most brilliant figure, the handsomest man of his time,
at least among the sovereigns, so that the impression he thus made was
actually a power in politics; we find him incessantly entangled in love
affairs: he was fond of music and enjoyment of all kinds, the pleasures
of the table, the uproar of riotous company: his debauched habits are
thought to have shortened his life, and many a disaster sprung from his
carelessness; but he had also Sardanapalus' nature in him: with quickly
awakening activity he always rose again out of his disasters; in his
battles he appeared the last, but he fought perhaps the best; and he won
them all. In the history of European Monarchy he is not unworthy to be
ranked by the side of Ferdinand the Catholic, Charles the Bold, Louis
XI, and some others who regained prestige for their dignity by the
energy of their personal character.</p>

<p>In itself we must rate it as important that he made good the birthright
of the house of York, independent as it was of the maxims of Parliament,
or rather contradictory to them, and maintained the throne. He deemed
himself the direct successor of Richard II; the three kings who had
since worn the crown by virtue of Parliamentary enactments were regarded
by him as usurpers. We have Fortescue's contemporary treatise in praise
of the laws of England, which (written for a prince who never came to
the throne) contains the idea of Parliamentary right which the house of
Lancaster upheld: but Edward IV did not so apprehend it. He allowed the
lawfulness of his accession to be recognised by Parliament, because this
was of use to him: but otherwise he paid little regard to its
established rights.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
We find under him for five years no meeting of
Parliament; then a Parliament that had met was prorogued some four or
five times without completing any business, till it at last agreed to
raise the customs duties, included under the names of Tonnage and
Poundage; a revenue which being voted to the Kings for life (and this
came gradually to be regarded as a mere formality) gave their government
a strong financial basis. Other Parliaments repaid their summons with
considerable grants, with large and full subsidies: yet Edward IV was
not content even with these. Under him began the practice, by which the
wealthy were drawn into contributions for his service in proportion to
their property, of which the King knew how to obtain accurate
information; these contributions were called Benevolences because they
were paid under the form of personal freewill offerings, though none
dared to refuse them:<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
we may compare the imposts which in the
Italian republics the dominant parties were wont to inflict on their
opponents. Though holding Church views in other points, and at any rate
a persecutor of the Lollards, he did not however allow the clergy to
enter on their temporalities without heavy payments: he created
monopolies in the case of some especially profitable articles of trade.
In short, he neglected no means to render the administration of the
supreme power independent of the money-grants of Parliament. He made
room for the royal prerogative as understood by the old kings, as well
as for the right of birth.</p>

<p>But yet he had not established a secure position, since the party of the
enemy was still very powerful, and after his early death a quarrel broke
out in his own house which could not fail to destroy it.</p>

<p>To the characteristic traits of the Plantagenets, their world-wide
views, their chivalry abroad, their versatility at home, the ceaseless
war they waged with each other and with others
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
for power, their
inextinguishable love of rule, belongs also the way in which those who
held power rid themselves of foes within their own family. As formerly
King John had murdered in prison Arthur the lawful heir to the throne,
so Richard II imprisoned and murdered his uncle Thomas of Gloucester,
who was dangerous to himself. Richard II, like Edward II, died by the
hand of a relative who had wrested the crown from him; of the details of
his death we have not even a legend left. Another Gloucester, who had
for many years guarded the crown for the infant Henry VI, was, at the
very moment when he might become dangerous to the new government, found
dead in his bed. So Henry VI perished in the Tower the day before Edward
IV made his entry into London. Edward IV preferred to have his brother
Clarence, though already under sentence of death, privately killed. But
the most atrocious murder of all was that of the two infant sons of
Edward IV himself; they were both murdered at once, as was fully
believed, at the behest of their uncle Richard III, who had put himself
in possession of the throne. I know not whether the actual character of
Richard answered to that type of inborn wickedness which commits crime
because it wills it as crime, such as following the hints of the
Chronicle<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
a great poet has drawn for us in imperishable traits, and
linked with his name: or whether it was not rather the love of power,
that animated the whole family, which in Richard III grew step by step
into a passion that made him forget all laws human and divine: enough,
he did such deeds that the world's abhorrence weighs justly on him.</p>

<p>But it was owing to the internal discord of the ruling family that
throughout the course of its history a path was made for political and
national development, and so it was now: these crimes opened a way out
of the disorders of the time. For as Richard, while continuing to
persecute the house of Lancaster, struck still harder blows against the
chief members of that of York, he gave occasion to the principal persons
of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
both parties, who were equally threatened, and had the same interest
in opposing the usurper, to draw nearer to each other.</p>

<p>The widowed Queen Elizabeth, who was lingering out her life in a
sanctuary, was brought into secret connexion through the mediation of
distinguished friends with the mother of the man who now came forward as
head of the Lancasters, Henry Earl of Richmond, and it was determined
that Henry and Elizabeth's daughter, in whom the claims of both lines
were united, should marry each other, a prospect which might well
prepare the way for the immediate combination of the two parties. Henry
of Richmond at their head was then to confront the usurper and chase him
from the throne. The fugitives scattered about in the sanctuaries and
churches called him to be their
captain.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>The question arises&mdash;it has been often answered in the negative&mdash;whether
Henry was rightfully a Lancaster, and whether he had any well-grounded
claims on the English crown. He loved to derive his family from the hero
of the Welsh, the fabulous Arthur. His grandfather, Owen Tudor, a
Welshman, was brought into connexion with the royal house by his
marriage with Henry V's widow, Catharine of France: for unions of royal
ladies with distinguished gentlemen were then not rare. And Owen Tudor
of course obtained by this a higher position, but there could be no
question of any claim to the crown. This was derived simply from the
fact that the son of this marriage, Edmund Tudor Earl of Richmond,
married a lady of the house of Somerset, descended by her father from
John of Gaunt, the ancestor of the Lancasters, by his third marriage
with Catharine Swynford. It has been said that this marriage, in itself
of an irregular nature, was only recognised as legitimate by Richard II
on the condition that the issue from it should have no claim to the
succession&mdash;and so it is in fact stated in the often printed Patent. But
the original of the document still exists, and that in two forms, one of
which is in the Rolls of Parliament, the other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
on the Patent Rolls. In
the first the limitation is wanting, in the second it exists, but as an
interpolation by a later hand. It may be taken as admitted that Richard
II in legitimising the marriage did not make this condition, and that it
was first inserted by Henry IV (who took offence at the legitimisation
of his half-brothers) at the ratification. But the legitimisation once
effected could not possibly be limited in a one-sided manner by a later
sovereign. I think no objection can be made to the legality of Henry
VII's claim, which then passed over to his
successors.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
The limitation belonged to those proceedings of one-sided caprice by which
Henry IV tried to secure for his direct descendants the perpetual
possession of the crown. It was not from him, but from his father, the
founder of the family, that the Earls of Richmond derived their claim.</p>

<p>Now that the banner of a true Lancaster appeared again in the field, and
the discontented Yorkists, ill-treated by Richard, joined him, it might
certainly be hoped that the usurper would be overthrown, and that a
strong power would emerge from the union of both lines. Yet the issue
was even then very doubtful.</p>

<p>As in the earlier civil wars, so now too the help of a foreign power was
necessary. With French help the Earl of Richmond led about 2000 men, of
which not more than perhaps 800 were English, to
Wales;<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
in his further advance he was joined by proportionately considerable
reinforcements; yet he did not number more than 5000 men under his
banners, badly clothed and still worse armed, when Richard with his
chivalry came upon him in overwhelming numbers. Henry would have been
lost, had he not found partisans in Richard's ranks. Even before the
engagement the desertion from Richard began: then in the middle of the
battle the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
chief division of his army passed over to Henry. Richard
found the death he sought: for he was resolved to be King or die: on the
battlefield itself Henry was proclaimed King.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that he owed to his union with the house of York,
whose right was then generally regarded as the best, not only his
victory, but the joyous recognition also which he experienced
afterwards: yet his whole nature revolted against basing his state on
this union: he cherished the ambition of ruling only through his own
right.</p>

<p>At the first meeting of Parliament, which he did not call till he was
fully in possession and crowned King, he was met by a very genuinely
English point of law. It arose from the fact that many members of the
Lower House had been attainted by the late government. How could they
make laws who were themselves beyond the pale of law? Who could cleanse
them from the stain that clove to them? This objection could be raised
against Henry himself. In this perplexity recourse was had to the
judges: and they decided that the possession of the crown supplied all
defects, and that the King was already King even without the assent of
Parliament.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
In the general disorder things had gone so far, that it
was necessary to find some power outside the continuity of legal forms,
from which they might start afresh. The actual possession of the throne
formed this time the living centre round which the legal state could
again form itself. By exercising the authority inherent in the
possession of the crown, the King could effect the revocation of the
sentences that weighed on his partisans and on a large portion of the
Parliament. After the legal character of that Assembly had been
established, it proceeded to recognise Henry's rights to the crown in
the words used for the first of the Lancastrian house.</p>

<p>In the papal bull which ratified Henry's succession, three grounds are
assigned for it: the right of war, the undoubted nearest right to the
succession, and the recognition by Parliament. On the first the King
himself laid great stress:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
he once designates the issue of the battle
as the decision of God between him and his foes. He thus avoided any
mention of the marriage with Edward IV's daughter, which he did not
complete till he was acknowledged on all sides. The papal bull declared
that the crown of England was to be hereditary in Henry's descendants,
even if they did not spring from the Yorkist marriage.</p>

<p>We can easily understand this: Henry would not tolerate by his side in
the person of his wife a joint ruler of equal, and even better, right
than his own; but we can understand also that this proceeding drew on
him new enmities. At the very outset the widowed Queen gave it to be
understood that her daughter was rather lowered than raised by the
marriage. The whole party of York moreover felt itself contemned and
insulted. To the ferment of displeasure and ambition into which it fell
must be attributed the fact that a pair of adventurers, who acted the
part of genuine descendants of the house of York, Lambert Simnel and
Perkin Warbeck, supported from abroad, found the greatest sympathy and
recognition in England. The first Henry VII had to meet in open battle,
the second he got into his hands only by a great European combination.</p>

<p>But he did not wish to have always to encounter open disturbance. He was
entirely of the opinion which his chancellor gave, that enmities of such
a sort could not be extinguished by the sword of war, but only by
well-planned and stringent laws which would destroy the seed of
rebellion, and by institutions strong enough to administer those laws.
Above all he found it intolerable that the great men kept numerous
dependents attached to them under engagements which were publicly
paraded by distinctive badges. The lower courts of justice and the
juries did not do the service expected from them in dealing with the
transgressions of the law that came before them. Uncertainty as to the
supreme authority, and the power which the great party-leaders
exercised, filled the weaker, who had to sit in judgment on them, with
dread of their sure revenge. To put an end to this disorder Henry VII
established the Starchamber. With consent of the Parliament, from which
all hostile pa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>rty-movements
were excluded, he gave his Privy Council,
which was strengthened by the chief judges, a strong organisation with
this end in view. It was to punish all those personal engagements, the
exercise of unlawful influence in the choice of sheriffs, all riotous
assemblies, lastly to have power to deal with the early symptoms of a
tumult before it came to an outbreak, and that under forms which were
not usual in the English administration of justice. This powerful
instrument in the hands of government might be much abused, but then
seemed necessary to keep in check unreconciled enemies and the spirit of
faction that was ever surging up again. We see the prevailing state of
things from the fact, that the King's councillors themselves, to be
secured against acts of violence, passed a special law, which
characterised attacks on them as attacks on the King himself. But then,
like men who stood in the closest connexion with the King and his State,
they used their authority with unapproachable severity. The internal
tranquillity of England has been thought to be mainly due to the
erection of this court of justice.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>Since Henry laid so much stress on his being a Lancaster, it might have
been expected that he would revive the rights of the Parliament. But in
this respect he followed the example of the house of York. He too
imposed Benevolences, like Edward IV, and that to a yet greater extent;
he made an ordinance that what was voluntarily promised should be
exacted with as much strictness as if it were an ordinary tax. Another
source of financial gain, which has brought on him still worse
reproaches, was his commission against infractions of the law. It was
inevitable that in the fluctuation of authority and of the statutes
themselves innumerable illegalities should have taken place. And they
were still always going on. The King took it especially ill that men
omitted to pay the dues which belonged to the crown in right of its
feudal superiority. All these negligences and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span> failures were now visited
and punished with the severity of the old Norman system, and at the same
time with the officiousness of party-men of the day, who saw their own
advantage in it. This proceeding pressed very many heavily on private
persons and communities, and ruined families, but it filled the King's
coffers. One of his maxims was that his laws should not be broken under
any circumstances, another that a sovereign who would enjoy
consideration must always have money: in this instance both worked
together.</p>

<p>If we look at the lists of his receipts we find that they consist, as in
other kingdoms, of the crown's revenue proper, which was considerably
increased by the escheated possessions of great families which had
become extinct, the customs duties settled on him for life, the tenth
from the clergy, and the feudal dues. It was estimated that they
produced nearly the same revenue as that of the French kings at this
time, but it was remarked that the King of England only spent about
two-thirds of his income. He did not need a Parliamentary grant,
especially as he kept out of dangerous foreign entanglements. In his
last thirteen years he never once called a Parliament.</p>

<p>This precisely corresponded to the idea of his government. After all had
become doubtful owing to the alternate fluctuations of parties he had
established his personal claim by the fortune of arms, and made it the
central point of his government. Was he to allow it to be again
endangered by the ceaseless ebb and flow of popular opinion? He founded
a supreme court independent of popular agitation, a finance system
independent of the grants of a popular assembly.</p>

<p>But he thus found himself under the disadvantage of having to apply
compulsion unceasingly: his government bore throughout the bitter and
hateful character of a party-government. With untiring jealousy he
watched the secret opponents who still looked out for some movement from
abroad, as a signal for fresh revolt: he kept diaries of their doings
and conduct: it was said he availed himself of the confessional for this
purpose: men whose names were from time to time solemnly cursed at S.
Paul's on account of past treasons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>, so that they counted for open
enemies, became useful to him as spies. If the decision lay between
services received and suspicious conduct, the latter easily weighed down
the balance, to the ruin of the victim. William Stanley, who had played
the most important part in the battle which decided the fate of the
crown, and was regarded as almost the first man in the realm after the
King, had at the appearance of Perkin Warbeck (who gave himself out as
Edward's younger son, Richard of York) let slip the words, 'he would
take his side, if he were the person he gave himself out to be.' He had
to atone for these words by his death, since he had intimated a doubt as
to the King's lawful right, which might mislead others into sedition.
Gradually the movements ceased: the high nobility showed a loyal
submission to the King: yet it did not attach itself to him, it let him
and his government alone. The King's principle was, to execute the laws
most strictly, yet he was not cruel by nature; if men implored his
mercy, he was ready to grant it. The contracted position of a sovereign,
who maintains his authority with the utmost strictness, does not however
exclude a paternal care for the country. Henry clipped his people's
wings, to accustom them to obedience, and then was glad when they grew
again. We find even that he made out a sketch of how the land should be
cultivated so that every man might be able to live. The people did not
love him, but it did not exactly hate him either: this was quite enough
for Henry VII.</p>

<p>A slight man, somewhat tall, with thin light-coloured hair, whose
countenance bore the traces of the storms he had passed through; in his
appearance he gave the impression of being a high ecclesiastic rather
than a chivalrous King. He was in this almost the exact opposite of
Edward IV. He too certainly arranged public festivities and spared no
expense to make them splendid, since his dignity demanded it, but his
soul took no pleasure in them, he left them as soon as ever he could; he
lived only in business. In his council sat men of mark, sagacious
bishops, experienced generals, magistrates learned in the law: he held
it to be his duty and his interest to hear their advice. And they were
not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span> without influence: one or two were noted as able to restrain his
self-seeking will. But the main affairs he kept in his own hands. All
that he undertook he conducted with great foresight and as a rule he
carried it through. Foreigners regarded him as cunning and deceitful; to
his own people his successful prudence seemed to have something
supernatural about it. If he had personal passions, he knew how to keep
them under; he seemed always calm and sober, sparing of words and yet
affable.</p>

<p>He directed almost his chief energies to this object, to keep off all
foreign influences from his well-ordered kingdom. </p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class='centersm'><a name="BII_II_I" id="BII_II_I"></a>
CHANGES IN THE CONDITION OF EUROPE.</p>

<p>For the history of the world the decisive event of the epoch was the
rapid rise of the French monarchy, which after it had freed itself from
the English invasions, became master of all the hitherto separate
territories of the great vassals, and lastly even of Brittany, and
rapidly began to make its preponderance felt on all sides.</p>

<p>Considered in itself no one would have been more called on to oppose
this than the King of England, who even still bore the title of King of
France. In fact Henry did once revive his claim on the French crown, on
Normandy and Guyenne, and took part in a coalition, which was to have
forced Charles VIII to give up Brittany; he crossed to Calais and
threatened Boulogne. But he was not in earnest with these comprehensive
views in his military enterprise, any more than Edward IV had once been
in a similar one. Henry VII was contented when a considerable money
payment year by year was secured to him, as it had been to Edward. The
English called it a tribute, the French a pension. It was acceptable to
the King, and advantageous for his home affairs, just at that
moment&mdash;1492&mdash;to have a sum of money at his free disposal.</p>

<p>And no one could have advised him to attach himself unconditionally to
the house of Burgundy. Duke Charles' widow was still alive, who found it
unendurable that the house of York, from which she sprang, should be
dethroned from its 'triumphant majesty, which shone over the seven
nations of the world'&mdash;for so she expressed herself. With her the
fugitive partisans of the house of York found refuge and protection: by
herself and her son-in-law Maximilian of Austria the pretenders
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
were fitted out who contested the crown with Henry VII. Henry could not
really wish Brittany to pass to his sworn foe, so that he might be
threatened from this quarter also at every moment. For how could he
delude himself with the hope that a transitory alliance would prevail
over a dynastic antipathy?</p>

<p>At this crisis Ferdinand the Catholic of Spain offered him an alliance
and connexion by marriage.</p>

<p>That which induced this sovereign to do so was above all Charles VIII's
invasion of Italy, and his conquest of Naples, to which the crown of
Aragon had just claims. His plan was to oppose to the mighty
consolidated power of France a family alliance with the
Austro-Burgundian House, with Portugal, above all with England: he hoped
that this would react on Italy, always wont to adhere to the most
powerful party. Ferdinand offered the King of England a marriage between
his youngest daughter Catharine and the Prince of Wales. In the English
Privy Council many objections were made to this; they did not wish to
draw the enmity of France on themselves and would have rather seen the
prince united to a princess of the house of Bourbon, as was then
proposed. It was on Henry VII's own responsibility that the offer was
accepted. In September 1496 an agreement was come to about the
conditions: on 15th August 1497 the ceremony of betrothal took place in
the palace at Woodstock.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>The motive which impelled Henry to his decision is sufficiently clear;
it was his relation to Scotland, on which the Spaniards already
exercised influence.</p>

<p>There the second pretender, Perkin Warbeck, had found a warm reception
from the young and chivalrous James IV: he there married a lady of one
of the chief houses: accompanied in person by this sovereign he made an
attempt to invade England, which only failed owing to the unfavourable
time of the year. The Spanish ambassador Pedro de Ayala
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
then out of
regard to Henry secured Perkin's withdrawal from Scotland. But in 1497
the danger revived in a yet greater degree. Warbeck landed in Cornwall
where all the inhabitants rallied round him, and a revolt already once
suppressed broke out again; at this moment James IV, urged on by the
nobles of the land, crossed the border with a splendid army: the
co-operation of the two movements might have placed the King in a
serious difficulty. Again it was the Spanish ambassador who made James
IV determine not to let himself be urged on further; but rather to give
him the commission, to adjust his differences with England. Henry VII
was set free to suppress the revolt in Cornwall; Perkin Warbeck was
taken in his flight.</p>

<p>As the object of the Spaniards was to sever Scotland from her old
alliance with France, and that too by means of a family alliance, it was
an essential point in their mediation that Henry VII, as he betrothed
his son Arthur to a Spanish Infanta, should similarly betroth his
daughter Margaret to James IV. The understanding with Spain and that
with Scotland went hand in hand.</p>

<p>And on another side too the alliance with Spain was very useful to the
King of England. Ferdinand had married his elder daughter Juana to
Maximilian's son the Archduke Philip: Philip could not possibly uphold
the Yorkist interests so zealously as his father or his grandmother. It
was an event of importance that at Whitsuntide 1500 a meeting took place
between the English and the Austro-Burgundian Court in the neighbourhood
of Calais. Henry applied himself to win over those whom he knew to be
his enemies: but at the same time he wished it to be remarked that the
Archduke showed him the honour which belongs to a lawful King. If there
were still Yorkist partisans in England, who placed their hopes in the
house of Burgundy, they would find that they had nothing more to hope
from that quarter.</p>

<p>So the Spanish alliance served the prudent and circumspect politician,
to secure him from any hostile action on the side of Scotland and the
Netherlands. When Catharine in 1501 came to England for her marriage,
she was received with additional joy because it was felt that her near
connex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>ion
with the Burgundian house promised good relations with the
Netherlands.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>But never was a more eventful marriage concluded.</p>

<p>We do not know whether the Prince of Wales had really consummated it
when he died before he was yet sixteen. But the two fathers were so well
satisfied with an alliance which increased the security of the one and
gained the other great consideration in the world, that they could not
bring themselves to give up the family connexion, by which it was so
much strengthened. The thought occurred to Ferdinand&mdash;a very unusual one
in the rest of the European world, though not indeed in Spain&mdash;of
marrying the Infanta to Henry, brother of the deceased prince, who was
now recognised as Prince of Wales. With his condolence for the loss he
united a proposal for the new marriage. In England from the beginning
men did not hide from themselves that as regarded the future succession,
which ought not to be contested from any side, the matter had its
delicate points. The solution which Henry found shows clearly enough the
natural tactics of the old politician. He obtained from the Roman Court
a dispensation for the new marriage, which expressly included the case
of the first marriage having been consummated. But it almost appears as
though he did not fully trust this authorisation. High as the prestige
of the supreme Pontiff still stood in the world, there were yet cases in
which canonists and theologians doubted as to his dispensing power; men
could not possibly have forgotten that, when Richard III wished to marry
his niece Elizabeth, a number of doctors disapproved of such a marriage,
even if the Pope should sanction it. At any rate Henry VII instigated,
or at least did not oppose, his son's solemnly entering a protest, after
the marriage ceremony between him and Catharine was performed, against
its validity (on the ground of his being too young), the evening before
he entered his fifteenth year, in the presence of the Bishop of
Winchester, his father's chief
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
Secretary of State. Hence all remained
undecided. Catharine lived on in England: her dowry did not need to be
given up; the general influence of the political union was saved; it
could however be dissolved at any moment, and there was therefore no
quarrel on this account with France, whence from time to time proposals
proceeded for a marriage in the opposite interest. The prince kept
himself quite free, to make use of the dispensation or not.</p>

<p>For the King himself too, whose wife died in 1503, many negociations
were entered into on both sides. The French offered him a lady of the
house of Angoulême; he preferred Maximilian's daughter, Margaret of
Austria, not indeed for her personal qualities, however praiseworthy
they might be; he stipulated after his usual fashion for the surrender
of the fugitive Edmund de la Pole, Earl of Suffolk, who was regarded as
the chief representative of the house of York, and (as once previously
in France) had at that time found a refuge in the Netherlands. Philip,
who after the death of his mother-in-law wished to take possession of
his wife's kingdoms in Spain, was on his voyage from Flanders driven by
a storm on the English coasts: he was Henry's guest at Windsor,
Richmond, and London. Here then the King's marriage with Philip's sister
was concerted, and with it the surrender of Suffolk. Philip strove long
against this: when he yielded, he at least got a promise that Henry VII
would spare the life of the earl, whom he accused of treason. He kept
his word: the prisoner was not executed till after his death.</p>

<p>Margaret had no inclination to wed herself with the harsh and
self-seeking King, who was growing old: he himself, when Philip shortly
after his arrival in Castile was snatched away by an early death, formed
the idea of marrying his widow Juana, though she was no longer in her
right mind. He opened a negociation about it, which he pursued with zeal
and apparent earnestness. The Spaniards ascribe to him the project of
marrying himself to Ferdinand's elder daughter, and his son to the
younger, and making the latter marriage, which he was purposely always
putting off, the price of his own. One should hardly ascribe such a
folly to the prudent and wise sovereign at his years and with his
failing stren<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>gth.
That he made the proposals admits of no doubt: but we
must suppose that he wished purposely to oppose to the pressure of the
Spaniards for the marriage of his son with the Infanta a demand which
they could never grant. For how could they let the King of England share
in Juana's immense claims of inheritance? Henry wished neither to break
off nor to complete his son's marriage; for the one course would have
made Spain hostile, while the second might have produced a quarrel with
France. Between these two powers he maintained an independent position,
without however mixing in earnest with their affairs, and only with the
view of warding off their enmity and linking their interests with his
own. His political relations were, as he said, to draw a brazen wall
round England, within which he had gradually become complete lord and
master. The crown he had won on the battlefield, and maintained as his
own in the extremest dangers, he bequeathed to his son as an undoubted
possession. The son succeeded the father without opposition, without a
rival&mdash;a thing that had not happened for centuries. He had only to
ascend the throne, in order to take the reins of government into his
hand.</p>

<p class='sect'><a name="BII_II_II" id="BII_II_II"></a>
Henry VIII and Cardinal Wolsey in their earlier years.</p>

<p>But that the political situation should continue as it was could not be
expected. What has not seldom in the history of great kingdoms and
states formed a decisive turning point now came to pass: to the father
who had founded and maintained his power with foresight and by painful
and continuous labour, succeeded a son full of life and energy, who
wished to enjoy its possession, and feeling firm ground under his feet
determined to live in a way more after his own mind. Henry VIII too felt
the need of being popular, like most princes on their accession: he
sacrificed the two chiefs of the fiscal commission, Empson and Dudley,
to the universal hate. In general his father's point of view seemed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
him too narrow-hearted, his proceedings too cautious.</p>

<p>The first great question which was laid before him concerned his
marriage: he decided for it without further delay. No doubt that in this
political reasons came chiefly into account. France had been ever
growing mightier, it had just then struck down the republic of Venice by
a great victory; men thought it would one day or another come into
collision with England, and held it prudent to unite themselves
beforehand with those who could then be useful as allies. At that time
this applied to the Spaniards above all
others.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
Yet, unless
everything deceives us, political considerations only coincided with the
prince's inclinations. The Infanta was in the full bloom of her age; the
prince, was even younger than herself and against his will had been kept
apart from any association with her, might well be impressed by her:
besides she had known how to conduct herself with tact and dignity in
her difficult position; with a blameless earnest mien she combined
gentleness and loveable qualities. The marriage was carried out without
delay; in the ceremonies of her husband's coronation Catharine could
actually take part as Queen. How fully did these festivities again
breathe the ancient character of chivalrous splendour. Men saw the
King's champion, with his own herald in front, in full armour, ride into
the hall on his war-steed which carried the armorial bearings of England
and France; he challenged to single combat any one who would dare to say
that Henry VIII was not the true heir of this realm; then he asked the
King for a draught of wine, who had it given him in a golden cup: the
cup was then his own.</p>

<p>Henry VIII had a double reason for confidence on his throne,&mdash;the blood
of the house of York also flowed in his veins. In European affairs he
was no longer content with keeping off foreign influences, he wished to
take part in them like his ancestors with the whole power of England.
After the dangers which had been overcome had passed out of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span> memory
of those living, the old delight in war awoke again.</p>

<p>When France now began to encounter resistance in her career of victory,
first through Pope Julius II, then through King Ferdinand, Henry did not
hesitate to make common cause with them. It marks his disposition in
these first years, that he took arms especially because men ought not to
allow the supreme Priest of Christendom to be
oppressed.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
When King
Louis and the Emperor Maximilian tried to oppose a Council to the Pope,
Henry VIII dissuaded the latter from it with a zeal full of unction. He
drew him over in fact to his side: they undertook a combined campaign
against France in which they won a battle in the open field, and
conquered a great city, Tournay. Aided by the English army Ferdinand the
Catholic then possessed himself of Navarre, which was given up to him by
the Pope as being taken when it was in league with an enemy of the
Church. Louis's other ally, the Scottish King James IV, succumbed to the
military strength of North England at Flodden, and Henry might have
raised a claim to Scotland, like that of Ferdinand to Navarre: but he
preferred, as his sister Margaret became regent there, to strengthen the
indirect influence of England over Scotland. On the whole the advantages
of his warlike enterprises were for England small, but not unimportant
for the general relations of Europe. The predominance of France was
broken: a freer position restored to the Papacy. Henry VIII felt himself
fortunate in the full weight of the influence which England had won over
European affairs.</p>

<p>It was no contradiction of the fundamental ideas of English policy, when
Henry VIII again formed a connexion with Louis XII, who was now no
longer formidable. He even gave him his younger sister to wife, and
concluded a treaty with him, by which he secured himself a money
payment, as his predecessors had so often done before. Yet he did not
for this break at all with Ferdinand the Catholic, though he had reason
to complain of him: rather he concluded a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
new alliance with him, only
in a less close and binding manner. He would not have endured that the
successor of Louis XII (who died immediately after his marriage), the
youthful and warlike Francis I, after he had possessed himself of Milan,
should have also advanced to Naples. For a moment, in consequence of
these apprehensions, their relations became less close: but when the
alarm proved to be unfounded, the alliance was renewed, and even Tournay
restored for a compensation in money. Many personal motives may have
contributed to this, but on the whole there was sense and system in such
a policy. The reconquest of Milan did not make the King of France so
strong that he would become dangerous, particularly as on the other side
the monarchy which had been prepared by the Spanish-Netherlands'
connexions now came into existence, and the grandson of Ferdinand and
Maximilian united the Spanish kingdoms with Naples and the lordship over
the Netherlands.</p>

<p>To this position between the two powers it would have lent new weight
and great splendour if the German princes could have been induced to
transfer to the King of England the peaceful dignity of a Roman-German
Emperor. He bestirred himself about this for a moment, but did not feel
it much when it was refused him.</p>

<p>But now since the empire too was added to the possessions in Spain,
Italy, and the Netherlands, and hence redoubled jealousy awakened in
King Francis I, which held out an immediate prospect of war, the old
question came up again before King Henry, which side England was to take
between them, and that in a more pressing form than ever. A special
complication arose from the fact that yet another person with separate
points of view now took part in the politics of the age.</p>

<p>In another point Henry VIII departed from his father's tactics and
habits; he no longer sat so regularly with his Privy Council and
deliberated with them. He had been persuaded that he would best secure
himself against prejudicial results from the discords that reigned among
them, by taking affairs more into his own hand. A young ecclesiastic,
his Almoner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
Thomas Wolsey, had then gained the greatest influence over
him; he had been introduced alike into business and into intimacy with
the King by Fox, Bishop of Winchester, who wished to oppose a more
youthful ability to his rivals in the Privy Council. In both relations
Wolsey was completely successful. It stood him in good stead that
another favourite, Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, who had married
Henry's sister (Louis XII's widow), and was the King's comrade in
knightly exercises and the external show of court-life, for a long time
remained in intimate friendship with him. Wolsey was conversant with the
scholastic philosophy, with Saint Thomas Aquinas; but that did not
hinder him from cooperating also in the revival of classical studies,
which were just coming into notice at Oxford: he had a feeling for the
efforts of Art which was then attaining a higher estimation, and an
inborn talent for architecture, to which we owe some wonderful
works.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
The King too loved building; the present of a skilfully cut
jewel could delight him; and he sought honour in defending the
scholastic dogmas against Luther's views; in all this Wolsey seconded
and supported him, he combined state-business with conversation. He
freed the King from the consultations of the Privy Council, in which the
intrinsic importance of the matter always weighs more than one's own
will; Henry VIII first felt himself to be really King when business was
managed by a favourite thoroughly dependent on him, trusted by him, and
in fact very capable. Wolsey showed the most many-sided activity and an
indefatigable power of work. He presided in court though he was not
strong in law; he mastered the department of finance; the King named him
Archbishop of York, the Pope Cardinal-Legate, so that the whole control
of ecclesiastical matters fell into his hands; foreign affairs were
peculiarly his own department. We have a considerable number of his
political writings and instructions remaining, which give us an idea of
the characteristics of his mind. Ve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>ry
circumstantially and almost
wearisomely do they advance&mdash;not exactly in a straight line&mdash;weighing
manifold possibilities, multiplied reasons: they are scholastic in form,
in contents sometimes fantastic even to excess, intricate yet acute,
flattering to the person to whom they are addressed, but withal filled
with a surprising self-consciousness of power and talent. Wolsey is
celebrated by Erasmus for his affability, and to a great scholar he may
have been accessible, but to others he was not so. When he went to walk
in the park of Hampton Court, no one would have dared to come within a
long distance of him. When questions were asked him he reserved to
himself the option of answering or not. He had a way of giving his
opinion so that every man yielded to him; especially as the possession
of the King's favour, which he enjoyed, made it impossible to oppose
him. If the government was spoken of, he was wont to say, 'the King and
I,' or 'we,' or at last 'I.' Just because he was of humble origin, he
wished to shine by splendid appearance, costly and rare furniture,
unwonted expenditure. Early one morning his appointment as Cardinal
arrived, that same morning at mass he displayed the insignia of his new
dignity. He required outward tokens of reverence, and insisted on being
served on bended knee. He had many other passions, of which the chief
was ecclesiastical ambition pervaded by personal vanity.</p>

<p>It gave him high satisfaction that both the great powers emulously
courted the favour and friendship of his King, of which he seemed to
have the disposal.</p>

<p>In June 1520 took place within the English possessions on French soil
the meeting between Henry VIII and Francis I, which is well designated
as the Field of the Cloth of Gold. It was properly a great tournament,
proclaimed in both nations, to which the chief lords yet once more
gathered in all their splendour. With the festivities were mingled
negociations in which the Cardinal of York played the chief part.</p>

<p>Immediately before this in England, and just afterwards on the
continent, Henry VIII met Charles V also, with less show but greater
intimacy; the negociations here took
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
the opposite direction.</p>

<p>In 1521, when war had already broken out between the two great powers,
the cardinal in his King's name undertook the part of mediator. There in
Calais he sat to a certain degree in judgment on the European powers.
The plenipotentiaries of both sovereigns laid their cases before him:
with apparent zeal and much bustle he tried at least to conclude a
truce: he complained once of the Emperor, that he disregarded his good
advice though weighty and to the point: on which the latter did come a
step nearer him. It was a magnificent position if he understood and
maintained it. The more powerful both princes became, the more dangerous
to the world their enmity should be, the more need there was of a
mediating authority between them. But the purity of intention which is
required to carry out such a task is seldom given to men, and did not
exist in Wolsey. His ambition suggested plans to him which reached far
beyond a peace arbitration.</p>

<p>When he promoted that first interview with Francis I against the will of
the great men and of the Queen of England, the Emperor's ambassadors,
who were thrown into consternation by it, remarked that the French King
must have promised him the Papacy, which however, they add, is rather in
the Imperial than in the royal gift. It does not appear that the Emperor
went quite so far at once, he only warned the cardinal against the
untrustworthy promises of the French, and sought to bring him to the
conviction&mdash;while making him the most advantageous offers&mdash;that he could
expect everything from him.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
Clear details he reserved till they met
in person; and then he in fact drew him over completely to his side.
Under Wolsey's influence King Henry, immediately on the outbreak of the
war, gave out his intention of making common cause with the Emperor. For
he had not, he said, so little understanding as not to see that the
opportunity was thus offered him of carrying out his predecessors'
claims and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
own, and he wished to use it. Only he preferred not to
commence war at once, since he was not yet armed, and since a broader
alliance should be first formed. The cardinal hoped to be able to draw
the Pope, the Swiss, and the Duke of Savoy, as well as the Kings of
Portugal, Denmark, and Hungary, into it. What an impression then it must
have made on him, when Pope Leo X, without being pressed, at once allied
himself with the Emperor! Wolsey's attempt at mediation&mdash;no room for
doubt about it is left by the documents that lie before us&mdash;was only
meant as a means of gaining time. At Calais Wolsey had already given the
imperial ambassadors, in the presence of the Papal Nuncio, the most
definite assurances as to the resolution of his King to take part in the
war against France. Before he returned to England to call the Parliament
together, which was to vote the necessary ways and means, he visited the
Emperor at Bruges. At the last negociations, being at times doubtful
about his trustworthiness, Charles V held it doubly necessary to bind
him by every tie to himself. He then spoke to him of the Papacy, and
gave him his word that he would advance him to that
dignity.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>The opportunity for this came almost too soon. When Leo X died, just at
this moment, Wolsey's hopes rose in stormy impatience. When the Emperor
renewed his assurance to him, he demanded of him in plain terms to
advance his then victorious troops to Rome, and put down by main force
any resistance to the choice proposed. Before anything could be done,
before the ambassador whom Henry VIII despatched at once to Italy
reached it, the cardinals had already elected, and elected moreover the
Emperor's former tutor, Hadrian. But was not this a proof of his
irresistible authority? Hadrian's advanced age made it clear that there
would be an early vacancy: and to this Wolsey now directed his hopes. He
gave assurance that he would administer the Papacy for the sole
advantage of the King and the Emperor: he thought then to overpower the
Fre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>nch,
and after completing this work he already saw himself in spirit
directing his weapons to the East, to put an end to the Turkish rule. At
his second visit to England the Emperor renewed his promise at Windsor
castle; he spoke of it in his conferences with the
King.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>
Altogether the closest alliance was concluded. The Emperor promised to marry
Henry's daughter Mary, assuming that the Pope would grant him the
necessary dispensation. Their claims to French territories they would
carry out by a combined war. Should a difficulty occur between them,
Cardinal Wolsey was fixed on as umpire.</p>

<p>So did the alliance between the houses of Burgundy and Tudor come to
pass, the basis of which was to be the annihilation of the power of the
Valois, and into which the English minister threw his world-wide
ambition. From England also a declaration of war now reached Francis I.
Whilst the war in Italy and on the Spanish frontiers made the most
successful progress, the English, in 1522 under Howard Earl of Surrey,
in 1523 under Brandon Earl of Suffolk, both times in combination with
Imperial troops, invaded France on the side of the Netherlands,
invasions which, to say the least, very much hampered the French.
Movements also manifested themselves within France itself, which awoke
hopes in the King that he might make himself master of the French crown
as easily as his father had once done of the English. Leo X had already
been persuaded to absolve the subjects of Francis I from their oaths to
him. It was in connexion with this that the second man in France, the
Constable of Bourbon, slighted in his station, and endangered in his
possessions, resolved to help himself by revolting from Francis I. He
wished then to recognise no other King in France but Henry VIII: at a
solemn moment, after receiving the sacrament, he communicated to the
English ambassador, who was with him, his resolution to set the French
crown on King Henry's head: he reckoned on a numerous party declaring
for him. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
And in the autumn of 1523 it looked as if this project would
be accomplished. Suffolk and Egmont pressed on to Montdidier without
meeting with any resistance: it was thought that the Netherland and
English forces would soon occupy the capital, and give a new form to the
realm. Pope Hadrian was just dead at Rome; would not the united efforts
of the Emperor and the King of England succeed, by their influence on
the conclave, especially now that they were victorious, in really
raising Wolsey to the tiara?</p>

<p>This however did not happen. In Rome not Wolsey but Julius Medici was
elected Pope; the combined Netherland and English troops retreated from
Montdidier; Bourbon saw himself discovered and had to fly, no one
declared for him. This last is doubtless to be ascribed to the vigilance
and good conduct of King Francis, but in the retreat of the troops and
in the election of the Pope other causes were at work. In the conclave
Charles V certainly did not act with as much energy for Wolsey as the
latter expected: Wolsey never forgave him. But he too has been accused
of having basely abused the confidence of the two sovereigns: he had
kept up friendly connexions all along with Francis I and his mother, and
they likewise had given him pensions and presents: he had purposely
supported the Earl of Suffolk so ill that he was forced to
retreat.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
Of all the complaints raised against him, not so much before the world
as among those who were behind the scenes, this was exactly the most
hateful and perhaps the most effectual.</p>

<p>In 1524 the English took no active part in the war. Not till February
1525, when the German and Spanish troops had won the great victory of
Pavia and King Francis had fallen captive into the Emperor's hands, did
their ambitious projects and thoughts of war reawaken.</p>

<p>Henry VIII reminded the Emperor of his previous promises, and invited
him to make a joint attack on France itself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
from both sides: they would
join hands in Paris; Henry VIII should then be crowned King of France,
but resign to the Emperor not merely Burgundy but also Provence and
Languedoc, and cede to the Duke of Bourbon his old possessions and
Dauphiné. The motive he alleges is very extraordinary: the Emperor would
marry his daughter and heiress, and would at some future time inherit
England and France also and then be monarch of the
world.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>
Henry declares himself ready to press on with the utmost zeal, provided he can
do it with some security, and himself undertake the conduct of the war
in the Netherlands and the support of Bourbon. The letter is from
Wolsey, full of copious and pressing conclusions; but should not the
far-reaching nature of its contents have been a proof even to him that
it could never be taken in earnest?</p>

<p>Charles V could not possibly enter into the plan. He had lent it a
hearing as long as it lay far away, but when it came actually close to
view, it was very startling for him. The union of the crowns of France
and England on the head of Henry VIII would in itself have deranged all
European relations, above all it would have raised that untrustworthy
man, who was still all powerful in his Council, to a most inconvenient
height of power. The Spanish kingdoms too were pressing for the
settlement of their succession. He was in the full maturity of manly
youth: he could not wait for Mary of England who had barely completed
her tenth year: he resolved to break off this connexion, and give his
hand to a Portuguese princess, who was nearly of his own age.</p>

<p>It could not be otherwise but that to the closest union, which was
broken at the moment when it might well have been able to attain its
object, the bitterest discord should succeed. </p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class='centersm'><a name="BII_III" id="BII_III"></a>
ORIGIN OF THE DIVORCE QUESTION.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is not a matter of such very great weight whether the Emperor
did his best for Wolsey in the conclave, or Wolsey his best for the
Emperor in the campaign of 1523. That the result did not correspond to
the expectations on either side was quite enough to bring about an
estrangement. What could the Emperor do with an English minister who was
not in a condition to support warlike enterprises properly? what could
the English do with an ally who appropriated to himself exclusively the
advantages of the victory they had won? Henry VIII, while trying to win
the French crown, had only weakened it, and thereby given the house of
Burgundy a preponderance in European affairs, by which all other powers,
and himself as well, felt themselves threatened.</p>

<p>After the battle of Pavia a feeling prevailed throughout the world that
the rule of Spain and Burgundy would be intolerable, if France were no
longer independent. The ministers of the Pope in Rome first came to a
consciousness of this: as the best means of restoring the balance, they
looked to the dissolution of the alliance between Henry VIII and Charles
V. The Pope's Datary, Giberti, made approaches to the English Court,
though still with timid caution, in order in the first place only to
propose a reconciliation between England and
France.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
To his joy he remarked that Henry VIII and Cardinal Wolsey were more
inclined to this plan than he had expected. If not before yet certainly
since his alienation from the Emperor, the cardinal had entered into
secret negociations with the mother of the King of France: the last
proposals to the Emperor had been only an attempt to turn the success of
his arms to the advantage of England also: when he rejected them, the
cardinal entered into the French connexion with increased zeal. Before
the end of the summer of 1523 peace between England and France was
effected with the sympathising co-operation of Rome.</p>

<p>In it the Regent Louise accepted the conditions laid down by the
cardinal: she did not neglect to secure him by a considerable pension.
From the beginning she had on her side also tried to excite his
world-wide ambition; for Francis I and Henry VIII, if once they became
friends, would do noble deeds to their own-undying renown and to the
glory of God, and the direction of their enterprises would fall to the
cardinal.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>Even after Henry VIII abandoned him, the Emperor still kept the upper
hand. He extorted the Peace of Madrid; the League of the Italian princes
with France, by which its execution was to have been hindered, and to
which England lent her moral support without actually joining it, led
Charles V to new victories, to the conquest of Rome, and hence to a
position in the world which now did really threaten the freedom of all
other nations. The necessary result was that France and England drew
still more closely together. Cardinal Wolsey appeared in France; a close
alliance was concluded and (not without considerable English help) an
army sent into the field, which in fact gained the upper hand in Italy
and restored to the Pope, who had escaped to Orvieto, some feeling of
independence. Soon the largest projects were formed on this side also,
in which the two Kings expected to have the Pope entirely with them. The
French declared their wish to conquer Naples and never restore it to the
Emperor, not even under the most favourable conditions.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span> Wolsey thought
that the Pope might pronounce the deposition of the Emperor in Naples
and even in the Empire, for which certain German electors could be won
over; he boasted that he would bring about such a revolution as had not
been seen for a century.</p>

<p>It was at this crisis in the general situation, and when an attempt was
being made to direct politics towards the annihilation of the Emperor,
that the thought occurred of dissolving Henry VIII's marriage with the
Emperor's aunt, the Infanta Catharine.</p>

<p>It is very possible, as a contemporary tradition informs us, that Wolsey
was instigated to this by personal feelings. His arrogant and wanton
proceedings, offensive by their excesses, and withal showing all the
priestly love of power, were hateful to the inmost soul of the pure and
earnest Queen. She is said to have once reproached him with them, and to
have even repelled his unbecoming behaviour with a threatening word, and
he on his part to have sworn to overthrow
her.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>
But this personal motive first became permanently important when joined with a more
general one. The Queen was by no means so entirely shut out from the
events of the day as has been asserted; in moments of difficulty we find
her summoning the members of the Privy Council before her to discuss the
pending questions with them. When Wolsey began a life and death struggle
with the Emperor, the influence of the Queen, whose most lively
sympathies were with her nephew, stood not a little in his way; it was
his chief interest to remove her.</p>

<p>It was indeed the feeling of the time, that family unions and political
alliances must go hand in hand. At the very first proposal for a
reconciliation between England and France, Giberti had advised the
marriage of the English princess Mary, who had been rejected by the
Emperor, with a French prince, and there had been much negociation about
it. But owing to the extreme youth of the princess it was soon felt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
that this would not lead to the desired end. If a definitive rupture was
to take place between England and the Burgundo-Spanish power, Henry
VIII's marriage with Catharine must be dissolved and room thus made for
a French princess. This marriage however was itself the result of that
former state of politics which had led to the first war with France.
Wolsey formed the plan of marrying his King, in Catharine's stead, with
the sister or even with the daughter of Francis I who was now growing
up:<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>
then only would the alliance between the two powers become
indissoluble. When he was in France in 1527, he said to the Regent, the
King's mother, that within a year she would live to see two things, the
most complete separation of his sovereign from Spain, and his
indissoluble union with
France.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>But to these motives of foreign policy was now added an extremely
important reason of home policy: this lay in the precarious state of the
Succession.</p>

<p>When the King several years before was congratulated on the birth of his
daughter, with an intimation that the birth of a son might have been
still more acceptable, he replied quickly, they were both still young,
he and his wife, why should they not still have a son? But gradually
this hope had ceased, and as hitherto no Queen had ever reigned in her
own right in England, the opinion gained ground that at the King's death
the throne would fall vacant. It had a little before created a party
among the people for the Duke of Buckingham, when he maintained that he
was the nearest heir to the crown, and would not let it be taken from
him. He had been executed for this: Mary's right to the succession met
with no further opposition; but even so it was still always a doubtful
future that lay before the country. People wished to marry Mary at one
time to the Emperor, at another to the King or a prince of France: so
that her claim to the inheritance of the crown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
should pass to the house
of Burgundy or to that of Valois. But how dangerous this was for the
independence of the country! Henry would surely not have lost himself in
Wolsey's intrigues, had he had a son and heir, to represent the
independent interests of England.</p>

<p>In other times relations of this kind would have probably been reckoned
as in themselves sufficient reason for a divorce: but not so in that
age. The very essence of marriage lies in this, that it raises the
union, on which the family and the order of the world rests, above the
momentary variations of the will and the inclination; by the sanction of
the Church it becomes one of that series of religious institutions which
set limits on every side to individual caprice. No one yet dared so far
to deny the religious character of marriage, as to have avowed mere
political views in wishing for a separation, either before the world, or
even to himself. But now there was no want of spiritual reasons which
might be brought forward for it. The King's own confessor revived the
doubts in him which had once been raised before his marriage with his
brother's widow. And when the King was then reminded that such a
marriage had been expressly forbidden in the books of Moses, and
threatened with the punishment of childlessness, how could it fail to
make an impression on him, when this threat seemed to be strictly
fulfilled in his case? Two boys had been born to him from this marriage,
but both had died soon after their birth. Even within the Catholic
Church it had been always a moot point whether the Pope could dispense
with a law of Scripture. The divine punishment inflicted on the King, as
he thought, seemed to prove that the Pope's dispensation (encroaching as
it did on the region of the divine power), on the strength of which the
marriage had been concluded, had not the validity ascribed to it.
Scruples of this sort cannot be said to be a mere pretence; they have
something of the half belief, half superstition, so peculiarly
characteristic of the spirit of the age and of that of the King. And
none could yet foresee what results they implicitly involved.</p>

<p>It still appeared possible that the Pope would revoke the dispensation
given by one of his predecessors, especially
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
as some grounds of
invalidity could be found in the bull itself. Wolsey's idea was that the
Pope, in the pressing necessity he was under of ranging England and
France against the preponderance of the Emperor, could be brought to
consent to recall the dispensation, and this would make the marriage
null and void from the beginning. Always full of arrogant assumption of
an influence to which nothing could be impossible, Wolsey assured the
King that he would carry the matter
through.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>When tidings of this proposal first reached Rome, those immediately
around the Pope took special notice of the political advantages that
might accrue from it. For hitherto there was a doubt whether Henry VIII
was really so decidedly in favour of France as was said: a project like
this, which would make him and the Emperor enemies for ever, left no
room for doubt about it. When the Pope saw himself secure of this
support in reserve, his word, in a matter which concerned the highest
personal and civil interests, acquired new weight even with the
Emperor.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>It is undeniable that the Pope at first expressed himself favourably. It
appeared to make an especial impression on him, that the want of a male
heir might cause a civil war in England, and that this must be
disadvantageous to the Church as
well.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>
He only asked not to be
pressed as long as he was in danger of experiencing the worst
extremities from the overwhelming power of the Emperor. In the spring of
1528, when the French army advanced victoriously into the Neapolitan
territory and drove back the Emperor's forces to the capital, Wolsey's
request for full powers to inquire into the affair in England was taken
into earnest consideration by the Pope. It was at Orvieto, in the Pope's
working room, which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
also his sleeping-chamber: a couple of
cardinals, the Dean of the Roman Rota, and the English plenipotentiaries
sat round the Pope, to talk over the case thoroughly. One of the
cardinals declared himself against the Commission demanded by Wolsey,
since such a grant contravened the usage of the last centuries in the
Roman tribunals; the Pope answered, that in a matter concerning a King
who had done such service to the Holy See, they might well deviate from
the usual forms; he actually delegated this Commission to Cardinal
Campeggi, whom the English esteemed as their friend, and to Wolsey.</p>

<p>By this nothing was yet effected: it even appears as though Clement VII
had given tranquillising promises to the Emperor; the Bishop of Bayonne
declared that the Pope's intention was thus to keep both sides dependent
on him&mdash;but it was at all events one step on the road once taken, which
aroused hope in England that it would lead to the desired end.</p>

<p>But let us picture to ourselves the enormous difficulty of the case. It
lay above all in the inner significance of the question itself. In his
first interview with Henry VIII Campeggi remarks that the King was
completely convinced of the invalidity of the Papal dispensation, which
could not extend to Scripture precepts. No argument could move him from
this; he answered like a good theologian and jurist. Campeggi says, an
angel from heaven would not make him change his opinion. He could not
but see that Wolsey cherished the same view.</p>

<p>But was it possible for the Roman court to yield in this and to revoke a
dispensation, which involved the very substance of its spiritual
omnipotence? It would have thus only strengthened, and in reality
confessed, the antagonism against its authority which was based on Holy
Scripture. Campeggi could not yield a hair's breadth.</p>

<p>The only solution lay&mdash;and Campeggi was authorised to attempt it&mdash;in
inducing Queen Catharine to renounce her place and dignity. Soon after
his arrival he represented to her at length how much depended on it for
her and the world, and promised her that in return not only all else
should be secured to her that she could desire, but above all that
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
succession of her daughter also should be guaranteed. The wish, in which
both Pope and King agreed, that she should enter a convent, Campeggi at
first did not mention to her; he thought she would herself seek for some
expedient. But she avoided this. Campeggi had spoken to her in the name
of the Pope: she only said she thought to abide till death in obedience
to the precepts of God and of the Church: she would ask for counsellors
from the King, would consult with them, and then communicate to the Holy
Father what her conscience bade her. Her consent still remained
possible. This gained, the legate would have no need to mention further
the validity or invalidity of the dispensation. He was still hoping for
it, when Wolsey came to him one morning early (26 Oct. 1528) and told
him the Queen had asked the King for leave to make her confession to him
(Campeggi), and had obtained it. A couple of hours later the Queen
appeared before him. She told him of her earlier marriage, which was
never really consummated; that she had remained as unchanged by it as
she had been from her mother's womb; and this destroyed all grounds for
the divorce. Campeggi was however far from drawing such a conclusion; he
advised her in plain terms to make a vow and enter a convent, repeating
the motives stated before, to which he now added the example of a Queen
of France. But his words died away without effect. Queen Catharine
declared positively that she would never act thus; she was called by God
to her marriage, and resolved to live and die in it. A judgment might be
pronounced in this matter; if the marriage was declared to be invalid,
she would submit, she would then be as free as the King; but without
this she would hold fast to her marriage union. She protested, in the
strongest terms conceivable, that they might kill her, they might tear
her limb from limb, yet she would not change her mind; had she two
lives, she would lay them both down in such a cause. It would be better,
she said, for the Pope to try to divert the King from his design; he
would then be able to trust all the more in the inclination of her
kinsman the Emperor to help in bringing about a peace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
In the presence of the counsellors given her at her wish, both legates
repeated two days later in a formal audience their admonition to the
Queen not to insist on a definite decision; but already Campeggi had
little hope left; he was astonished that the lady, usually so prudent,
should in the midst of peril so obstinately reject judicious
advice.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>The question between King and Queen was, we might say, also of a
dogmatic nature. Had the Pope the right to dispense with the laws of
Scripture or had he not? The Queen accepted it as it had been accepted
in recent times, especially as the presupposed conditions of a marriage
had not been fulfilled in her case. The King rejected it under all
circumstances, in agreement with scholars and the rising public opinion.</p>

<p>But into this question various other general and personal reasons now
intruded themselves. If the question were answered in the negative
Wolsey held firmly to the view of forming an indissoluble union between
France and England, of securing the succession by the King's marriage
with a French princess, of restoring universal peace; to this he added
the project, as he once actually said in confidential discourse, of
reforming the English laws, doubtless in an ecclesiastical and monarchic
sense; if he had once accomplished all this, he would retire, to serve
God during the rest of his life.</p>

<p>But he had already (and a sense of it seems almost to be expressed in
these last words so unlike his usual mode of thought) ceased to be in
agreement with his King. Henry VIII wished for the divorce, the
establishment of his succession by male offspring, friendship with
France, and Peace: but he did not care for the French marriage. He was
some years younger than his wife, who inclined to the Spanish forms of
strict devotion, and regarded as wasted the hours which she spent at her
dressing table. Henry VIII was addicted to knightly exercises of arms,
he loved pleasant company, music, and art; we cannot call him a gross
voluptuary, but he was not faithful to his wife: he already had a
natural son; he was ever entangled in new
connexi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>ons
of this kind. Many
letters of his survive, in which a tincture of fancy and even of
tenderness is coupled with a thorough sensuousness; just in the fashion
of the romances of chivalry which were then being first printed and were
much read. At that time Anne Boleyn, a lady who had lately returned from
France, and appeared from time to time at Court, saw him at her feet;
she was not exactly of ravishing beauty, but full of spirit and grace
and with a certain reserve. While she resisted the King, she held him
all the faster.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>The reasons of home and foreign policy mentioned above, and even the
religious scruples, have their weight; but we cannot shut our eyes to
the fact that this new passion, nourished on the expectation of the
divorce which was not unconditionally refused by the spiritual power,
gave the strongest personal impulse to carry the affair through.</p>

<p>The position of parties in the State also influenced it. Wolsey who had
diminished the consequence of the great lords, and kept them down, and
offended them by his pride, was heartily hated by them. Adorned though
he was with the most brilliant honours of the Church, yet for the great
men of the realm he was nothing but an upstart: they had never quite
given up the hope of living to see his fall. But if he brought the
French marriage to pass, as he designed, he would have won lasting
support and have become stronger than ever. Besides the great men took
the Burgundian side, not that they wished to make the Emperor lord of
the world, but on the other hand they did not want a war with him:
merchants and farmers saw that a war with the Netherlands, where they
sold their wool, would be an injury to all. When Wolsey flattered the
Pope with the hope of an attack on the Netherlands, he was, the Bishop
of Bayonne assures us, the only man in the country who thought of it. He
felt keenly the universal antipathy which he had awakened, and spoke of
the efforts and devices he would have need of,
to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
maintain himself.</p>

<p>It was therefore just what the nobles wanted, that Wolsey fell out with
the King in a matter of such engrossing nature, and that they found
another means of access to him.</p>

<p>The Boleyns were not of noble origin, but had been for some time
connected with the leading families. Geoffrey the founder of the house
had raised himself by success in business and good conduct to the
dignity of Lord Mayor of London. His son William married the daughter of
the only Irish peer who had a seat and vote in the English Parliament,
Sir Thomas Ormond de Rochefort, Earl of Wiltshire. His titles passed
through his daughter to his grandsons, of whom one, Thomas Boleyn, was
created Viscount Rochefort, and married the daughter of the Duke of
Norfolk; his daughter was Anne Boleyn: she took high rank and an
especially distinguished position in English society because her uncle,
Thomas Duke of Norfolk, was Henry VIII's chief lay minister (he held the
place of High Treasurer) and was at the same time the leading man of the
nobility. He had the reputation of being versed in business, cultivated,
and shrewd; he was Wolsey's natural opponent. That the King showed an
inclination to his niece, against the cardinal's views, was for him and
his friends a great point
gained.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>
It was soon seen that Anne's
influence had obtained the recall of an opponent of Wolsey, who had
insulted him and was banished from the
Court.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>
It was of the greatest
importance for home affairs, that the King was inclined to make Anne
Boleyn his wife. The English kings in general did not think marriages in
their own rank essential. Henry's own grandfather, Edward IV, had
married a lady of by no means distinguished origin. It was seen
beforehand that, if this happened, Wolsey could not maintain himself,
and authority would again fall into the hands of the chief families.
Even the cardinal's old friend, the Earl of Suffolk, now joined this
combination: the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
whole of the nobility sided with it.</p>

<p>But besides this the chief foreign affairs took a turn which made it
impossible to carry out Wolsey's political ideas. In the summer of 1528
the attacks of the allies on Naples were repulsed, and their armies
annihilated. In the spring of 1529 the Emperor got the upper hand in
Lombardy also. How utterly then did the oft-proposed plan, of depriving
him of the supreme dignity, sink into nothingness: he was stronger than
ever in Italy. The Pope was fortunate in not having joined the allies
more closely; the relations of the States of the Church with Tuscany
made a union with the Emperor necessary; he had a horror of a new
quarrel with him. And as the Emperor now took up the interests of his
mother's sister in the most earnest manner, and protested against
proceeding by a Commission granted for England, the Pope could not
possibly let the affair go on unchecked. When the English ambassadors
pressed him, he exclaimed to them (for apart from this he would gladly
have shown more favour to the King) that he felt himself as it were
between anvil and hammer. Divers proposals were made, one more
extraordinary than the other, if only the King would give up his
demand;<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>
but this was no longer possible. The two cardinals, Campeggi
and Wolsey, had to begin judicial proceedings: King and Queen appeared
before the Court, Articles were put forward, witnesses heard: the
Correspondence shows that the King and Anne Boleyn expected with much
confidence a speedy and favourable
decision.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
Wolsey too did not yet
abandon this hope. It was thought at the ti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>me that he did not do all he
might have done for it, that in fact he no longer favoured it, seeing as
he did that it would turn out to the advantage of his
rivals.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>
But it was in truth his fate, that the consequences of the design which
originated with him recoiled on his own head. If it succeeded, it must
be disadvantageous to him: if it failed, he was lost. The exhortations
he addressed to the French Court, to exert yet once more its whole
influence with the Papal Court for this matter, sound like a cry of
distress in extreme peril. He had only undertaken it to unite France and
England; the thing was reasonable and practicable, the Pope would not
wish by refusing it to offend both crowns at once; he would value it
more highly than if he himself were raised to the Papacy. But he had now
to find that King Francis, as well as Pope Clement, was seeking a
separate peace with the Emperor. Wolsey had given Henry the strongest
assurances on this point, that such a thing would never happen, France
would never separate herself from him. But yet this now happened, and
how could any influence from that quarter on the Roman Court be still
expected in favour of England, in a matter which was so highly offensive
to the Emperor! The legates received from Rome distinct instructions to

While King Henry and those around him were eagerly expecting it, the cardinals
(using the holidays of the Roman Rota as a pretence) announced the
suspension of their proceedings.</p>

<p>It appeared in an instant into what a violent ebullition of wrath, which
unsettled every thing, the King fell in consequence; it seemed as if all
his past way of governing had been a mistake. In contradiction to many
of the older traditions of English history he had hitherto ruled chiefly
through ecclesiastics to the disgust of the lay lords: now he betook
himself to the latter, to complain of the proceedings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span> of the two
cardinals. These were still in the hall where they had sat, when Suffolk
and some other lords appeared, and bade them bring the matter to an end
without delay, even if it were by a peremptory decree, that might be
issued on the next day, on which the holidays would not have begun. But
the prorogation was in fact only the form under which the cardinals
fulfilled their orders from Rome; they could not possibly recall it.
Suffolk broke out into the exclamation that cardinals and legates had
never brought good to England. The two spiritual lords looked at each
other with amazement. Had they any feeling that his words contained a
declaration of war on the part of the lay element in the State against
ecclesiastical and foreign influences in general? Wolsey, at any rate,
could not shut his eyes to the significance of such a war. He often said
that what Henry VIII took in hand he could not be brought to give up by
any representations; he had sometimes tried it, he had fallen at his
feet, but it had been always in vain.</p>

<p>Henry contained himself yet a while, as hopes had been given him that
the proceedings might be resumed. But when a Breve came, by which
Clement VII recalled his Commission and evoked the question of the
divorce to Rome, he saw clearly that the influence of the Emperor in the
Pope's Council had quite gained the upper hand over his own on this
point. He was resolved not to submit to it. Had he not, before the mayor
and aldermen of London, declared with a certain solemnity his resolution
to carry through the divorce for the good of the land? his passion and
his ambition had joined hands for this purpose before the eyes of the
country. To prevent the need of recoiling, he formed a plan of
incalculable importance, the plan of separating his nation and his
kingdom from the spiritual jurisdiction of the Roman See. </p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class='centersm'><a name="BII_IV" id="BII_IV"></a>
THE SEPARATION OF THE ENGLISH CHURCH.</p>

<p>Already at Orvieto Stephen Gardiner had told the Pope that, if the King
did not obtain justice from him, he would do himself justice in his own
kingdom. Later it was plainly declared to the Pope that, if they saw the
Emperor had the ascendancy in his Council, the nobility of England with
the King at their head would feel themselves compelled to cast off
obedience to Rome. It seems as though the Roman Court however had no
real fear of this. For the King, so they said, would do himself most
damage by such a step.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>
The Papal Nuncio declared himself positively
convinced, that it was necessary to deal with the English sharply and
forcibly, if one would gain their respect.</p>

<p>But these tendencies were more deeply rooted among the English than was
remembered at Rome. They went back as far as the Articles of Clarendon,
the projects of King John, the antipapal agitation under Edward III; the
present question which involved an exceptionable and personal motive,
exposed to public disapprobation, nevertheless touched on the deepest
interests of the country. The wish to make the succession safe was
perfectly justifiable. According to Clement VII's own declarations, the
English were convinced that he was only hindered by regard for the
Emperor from coming to a decision which was essential to them. His
vacillation is very intelligible, very natural: but it did not
correspond to the idea of the dignity with which he was clothed. There
was to be an independent supreme Pontiff for this very
reason,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
that right might be done in the quarrels of princes, without respect of
persons, according to the state of the case. It clashed with the idea of
the Papacy that alterations of political relations exercised such a
decisive influence as they did in this matter. There was indeed
something degrading for the English in their being made to feel the
reaction of the Emperor's Italian victory, and his preponderance, in
their weightiest affairs.</p>

<p>Henry VIII had now made up his mind to throw off that ecclesiastical
subjection, which was politically so disadvantageous; the circumstances
were very favourable. It was the time at which some German
principalities, and the kingdoms of the North, had given themselves a
constitution which rested on the exclusion of the hierarchic influences
of Rome: the King could reckon on many allies in his enterprise.
Moreover he had no dangerous hostilities to fear, as long as the
jealousy lasted between the Emperor and King Francis. Between them Henry
VIII needed only to revert to his natural policy of neutrality.</p>

<p>And the accomplishment of the affair was already prepared in the country
itself, through no one more than through Cardinal Wolsey.</p>

<p>The dignity of legate, which was granted him by Pope Leo, and then
prolonged for five, for ten years, and at last for life, gave him a
comprehensive spiritual authority. He obtained by it the right of
visiting and reforming all ecclesiastical persons and institutions, even
those which possessed a legal exemption of their own. Some orders of
monks, which contended against it, were reduced to obedience by new
bulls. But from the visitation of the monasteries Wolsey proceeded to
their suppression: he united old convents (such as that one which has
brought down to recent times the name of an Anglo-Saxon king's daughter,
Frideswitha, from the eighth century) with the splendid colleges which
he endowed so richly, for the advancement of learning and the renown of
his name, at Oxford and at Ipswich. His courts included all branches of
the ecclesiastical and mixed jurisdiction, and the King had no scruple
in arming him with all the powers of the crown which were necessary for
the government of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>Church. What aspirations then arose are shewn by
the compact which Wolsey made with King Francis I to counteract the
influence which the Emperor might exert over the captive Pope. When it
was settled in this, that whatever the cardinal and the English prelates
should enact with the King's consent should have the force of law, does
not this imply at least a temporary schism?</p>

<p>When Clement became free, he named Wolsey his Vicar-General for the
English Church: his position was again to be what it had been from the
beginning, the expression of the unity between the Pope and the Crown.
But now how if this were dissolved? The victorious Emperor exercised a
still greater influence over the Pope when free than he had ever done
over him when captive. Under these circumstances Wolsey submitted to the
supreme spiritual power, the King resolved to withstand it: it was
exactly on this point that open discord broke out between them. For a
time the cardinal seemed still to maintain his courage; but when on St.
Luke's day&mdash;the phrase ran that the evangelist had disevangelised
him&mdash;the great seal was taken from him, he lost all self-reliance.
Wolsey was not a Ximenes or a Richelieu. He had no other support than
the King's favour; without this he fell back into his nothingness. He
was heard to wail like a child: the King comforted him by a token of
favour, probably however less out of personal sympathy than because he
could not be yet quite dispensed
with.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>
The High Treasurer, Norfolk,
who generally acted as first minister, received the seals, and held them
till some time afterwards Thomas More was named Chancellor. While these
administered affairs in London, Suffolk, as President of the Privy
Council, was to accompany the King in person. The chief direction of the
administration passed over to the two leading lay lords.</p>

<p>Henry VIII's resolution to call the Parliament together was of almost
greater importance for the progress of events than the alteration in the
ministry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
During the fourteen years of his administration Wolsey had summoned
Parliament only once, and that was when, in order to carry on the war in
alliance with the Emperor against France, he needed an extraordinary
grant of money. But his opening discourses were received with silence
and dislike. Never, says a contemporary who was present, was the need of
money more pressingly represented to a Parliament and never was there
greater opposition; after a fortnight's consultation the proposal only
passed at a moment when the members of the King's household and court
formed the majority of thosepresent.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>
The Parliament and the
country always murmured at Wolsey's oppressive and lavish finance
management;<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>
a later attempt to raise taxes that had not been voted
doubled the outcry against him. His fall and the convocation of a
Parliament seemed a return to parliamentary principles in general, which
in themselves exactly agreed with the view taken by the King in the
present questions.</p>

<p>In the first years of Henry VIII the Parliament had wished to do away
with some of the most startling exemptions of the clergy from the
temporal jurisdiction, for instance in reference to the crimes of felony
and murder; the ecclesiastics had on the other hand extended their
jurisdiction yet further, even to cases that had reference solely to
questions of property. Hence the antagonism between the two
jurisdictions had revived at that time with bitter keenness. It is
noticeable that the temporal claims were upheld by a learned Minorite,
Henry Standish, who declared it to be quite lawful to limit the
ecclesiastical privileges for the sake of the public good; especially in
the case of a crime that did not properly come before any spiritual
court. Both sides then applied to the King: the ecclesiastics reminded
him that he ought to uphold the rights of Holy Church, the laymen that
he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
should maintain the powers of jurisdiction belonging to the crown.
The King's declaration was favourable to the laymen; he recommended the
clergy to acquiesce in some exceptions from their decretals. But the
contest was rather suspended than decided. Wolsey's government followed,
in which the spiritual courts extended their powers still further, and
in reality exercised an offensive control over all the relations of
private life. Even the ecclesiastics did not love his authority: they
acquiesced in it because it was ecclesiastical: the laity endured it
with the utmost impatience.</p>

<p>It was inevitable that at the first fresh assembly of a Parliament these
contests about jurisdiction should be mentioned. The Lower House began
its action with a detailed charge against the spiritual courts, not
merely against their abuses and the oppression that arose from them, but
against their very existence and their legislation; the clergy made laws
without the King's foreknowledge, without the participation of any
laymen, and yet the laity were bound by them. The King was called on to
reconcile his subjects of the spiritual and temporal estate with each
other by good laws, since he was their sole head, the sovereign, lord
and protector of both parties.</p>

<p>It was a slight phrase.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>
'the sole head of his subjects spiritual
and temporal,' but one of the weightiest import. The very existence of
the clergy as an order had hitherto depended precisely on their claim to
a legislative power independent of the temporal supremacy as being their
original right: on its universal maintenance rested the Papacy and its
influence on the several countries. Were the clergy now to leave it to
the King, who however only represented the temporal power, to adjust the
differences between their legislation and that of the state? Were they,
like the laity, virtually to recognise him as their Head?</p>

<p>It is clear that they would thus sever themselves from the great union
under one spiritual Head, from the
constitution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
of the Latin Church.
Whoever it was that introduced the word 'Head,' no doubt had this in
view. The King and the laity took it up, they wished only to induce the
clergy themselves to come to a resolution in this sense.</p>

<p>The chief motive which was to serve this purpose is connected with the
lordship which the Popes possessed in England in the thirteenth century,
or rather with the reaction against it which went on throughout the
fourteenth. This is most distinctly expressed in the statutes of 1393,
which threatened with the severest penalties all participation in any
attempt, to the injury of the King's supremacy, to obtain a
church-benefice from Rome; and this too even where the King had given
his consent to it. Clergy and laity were thus allied against the
encroachments of the Roman Curia. Wolsey was now accused of having
transgressed thisstatute:<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>
he had in virtue of his legatine power
given away benefices, and established a jurisdiction by which that of
the King was encroached on; he was found guilty of this in regular form.
He anticipated the full effect of this sentence by submitting without
any defence and surrendering all his property to the King. It was then
that York House in Westminster, with its gardens and the land adjoining,
the Whitehall of later times, passed into the possession of the
crown.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>
He still kept his archbishopric; we find him soon after at
Caywood, the palace belonging to it, and in fact even busied once more
with his buildings. At times the King again thought of his old
counsellor, and to many it quite seemed as though he might yet recover
power. In those days the general belief was, that Anne Boleyn had
exerted her whole influence against it. But most of the other persons of
distinction in court and state were also opposed to Wolsey. Did he then
really, as was imputed to him, try to gain a party among the clergy, and
move the Pope to pronounce excommunication against the
King?<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>
A pretext at any rate was found for arresting him as a traitor:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
but as he
was being brought to the Tower, he died on the way. He wished, so far as
we know, to starve himself to death; it was at that time supposed that
in his wish to die he was aided by help from others.</p>

<p>Neither for his mental nor for his moral qualities can Wolsey be
reckoned among men of the first rank; yet his position and the ability
which he showed in it, his ambition and his political plans, what he did
and what he suffered, his success and his fall, have won him an
imperishable name in English history. His attempt to link the royal
power with the Papacy by the closest ties rent them asunder for ever. No
sooner was he dead than the clergy became subject to the Crown&mdash;a
subjection which could forebode nothing less than this final rupture.</p>

<p>The whole clergy was so far involved in Wolsey's guilt that it had
supported his Legatine Powers, and so had shared in the violation of the
statutes. It shows the English spirit of keeping to the strict letter of
the law, that the King, though he had for years given his consent and
help in all this, now came forward to avenge the violation of the law.
To avert his displeasure the Convocation of Canterbury was forced to
vote him a very considerable sum of money, yet even this did not satisfy
him. Rather it seemed to him the fitting and decisive moment for forcing
the clergy, conformably with the Address of the Commons, to accept the
Anglican point of view. He demanded from Convocation the express
acknowledgment that they recognised him as <i>the Protector and the
Supreme Head of the Church and Clergy of England</i>; he commanded the
judges not to issue the Act of Pardon unless this acknowledgment were at
once incorporated with the bill for the money payment. It is not hard to
see what made him choose this exact moment for so acting; it was the
serious turn which the affair of his Divorce had taken at Rome. He had
once more made application to the Curia to let it be decided in England;
the Cardinals discussed the point in their Consistory, Dec. 22, 1530,
but resolved that the question must come of right before the Assessors
of the Rota, who should afterwards report on it to the Sacred
College.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>
What their sentence would be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
was the less doubtful, since
the Curia was now linked closer than ever with the Emperor, who had just
closed the Diet of Augsburg in the way they wished, and was now about to
carry out its decrees. The traces of a new alliance with Rome, which was
imputed to Wolsey as an act of treason, must have contributed to the
same result. The King wished to break off this connexion by a
Declaration, which would serve him as a standing-ground later on, and
show the Court of Rome that he had nothing to fear from it. On Feb. 7,
1531, the King's demand was laid before both Houses of Convocation. Who
could avoid seeing its decisive significance for the age? The clergy,
which had without much trouble agreed to the money-vote, nevertheless
strove long against a Declaration which altered their whole position.
But a hard necessity lay on them. In default of the Pardon, which, as
the judges repeatedly assured them, depended on this Declaration, they
would have found themselves out of the protection of the King and the
Law. They sent two bishops, to get the King's demand softened by a
personal appeal; Henry VIII refused to hear them. They proposed that
some members of both Houses should confer with the Privy Council and the
judges; the answer was that the King wished for no discussion, he wanted
a clear answer. Thus much however they ascertained, that the King would
be content with a mode of statement in which he was unconditionally
recognised as the protector and sovereign of the Church and clergy of
England, but as its supreme head only so far as religion allows. This
was comprehended in the formula <i>in so far as is permitted by the law of
Christ</i>, an expression which men might assent to on opposite grounds.
Some might accept it from seeing in it only the limitation which is set
to all power by the laws of God; others from thinking that it excluded
generally the influence of the secular power on what were properly
spiritual matters. When the clause was laid before them, at the morning
sitting of Feb. 11, it was received with an ambiguous silence; but on
closer consideration, it was so evidently their only possible resource,
that in the afternoon, first the Upper House of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
Convocation, and then
the Lower, gave their consent. Then the King accepted the money-bill,
and granted them in return the Act of
Pardon.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p>The clergy had yet other causes for seeking the King's protection. The
writings of the Reformers, which attacked good works and vows, the Mass
and the Priesthood, and all the principles on which the ecclesiastical
system rested, found their way across the Channel, and filled men's
minds in England also with similar convictions. The only safeguard
against them lay in the King's power; his protection was no empty word,
the clergy was lost if it drew on itself Henry's aversion, which was now
directed against the Papal See.</p>

<p>The heavy weight of the King's hand and the impulse of self-preservation
were however not the only reasons why they yielded. It is undeniable
that the conception of the Universal Church, according to which the
National Church did but form part of a larger whole, was nearly as much
lost among the clergy as among the laity. In the Parliament of 1532
Convocation had presented a petition in which they desired to be
released from the payments which had been hitherto made to the supreme
spiritual authority, especially the annates and first-fruits. The
National Church was the existing, immediate authority&mdash;why should they
allow taxes to be laid on them for a distant Power, a Power moreover of
which they had no need? As the bishops complained that this injured
their families and their benefices, Parliament calculated the sums which
Rome had drawn out of the country on this ground since Henry VII's time,
and which it would soon draw at the impending vacancies; what losses the
country had already suffered in this way, and would yet
suffer.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p>The tendency of men's minds in this direction showed itself also in the
understanding come to on the chief question of all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
Parliament renewed its complaints of the abuses in the ecclesiastical
legislation, and learned men brought out clearly the want of any divine
authority to justify it; at last the bishops virtually renounced their
right of special legislation, and pledged themselves for the future not
to issue any kind of Ordinance or Constitution without the King's
knowledge and consent. A revision of the existing canons by a mixed
commission, under the presidentship of their common head, the King, was
to restore the unity of legislation.</p>

<p>The clause was then necessarily omitted by which the recognition of the
Crown's supremacy over the clergy had been hitherto limited. The
defenders of the secular power put forth the largest claims. They said,
the King has also the charge of his subjects' souls, the Parliament is
divinely empowered to make ordinances concerning them
also.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>So a consolidation of public authority grew up in England, unlike
anything which had yet been seen in the West. One of the great statutes
that followed begins with the preamble that England is a realm to which
the Almighty has given all fulness of power, under one supreme head, the
King, to whom the body politic has to pay natural obedience, next after
God; that this body consists of clergy and laity; to the first belongs
the decision in questions of the divine law and things spiritual, while
temporal affairs devolve on the laity; that one jurisdiction aids the
other for the due administration of justice, no foreign intervention is
needed. This is the Act by which, for these very reasons, legal appeals
to Rome were abolished. It was now possible to carry out what in
previous centuries had been attempted in vain. All encroachments on the
prerogative of the 'Imperial Crown' were to be abolished, the supreme
jurisdiction of the Roman Curia was to be valid no longer; appeals to
Rome were not only forbidden but subjected to penalties.</p>

<p>The several powers of the realm united to throw off the foreign
authority which had hitherto influenced them, and which limited the
national independence, as being itself a higher
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
power.</p>

<p>As the oaths taken by the bishops were altered to suit these statutes,
the King set himself to modify his coronation oath also in the same
sense. He would not swear any longer to uphold the rights of the Church
in general, but only those guaranteed to the Church of England, and not
derogatory to his own dignity and jurisdiction; he did not pledge
himself to maintain the peace of the Church absolutely, but only the
concord between the clergy and his lay subjects according to his
conscience; not, unconditionally, to maintain the laws and customs of
the land, but only those that did not conflict with his crown and
imperial duties. He promised favour only for the cases in which favour
ought to find a
place.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>How predominant is the strong feeling of aggrandisement, of personal
right, and of kingly independence!</p>

<p>Henry VIII too regarded himself as a successor of Constantine the Great,
who had given laws to the Church. True, said he, kings are sons of the
Church, but not the less are they supreme over Christian men. Of the
doctrines which came from Germany none found greater acceptance with him
than this&mdash;that every man must be obedient to the higher powers. We
possess Tyndale's book in which these principles are set forth; by Anne
Boleyn's means it came into Henry's hands. That Pope Clement summoned
him formally before his judgment-seat, he declared to be an offence to
the Kingly Majesty. Was a Prince, he exclaims, to submit himself to a
creature whom God had made subject to him; to humble himself before a
man who, in opposition to God and Right, wished to oppress him? It would
be a reversal of the ordinance of
God.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>Whilst we follow the questions which here come into discussion&mdash;on the
relations of Church and State, the rights of nations and
kings&mdash;questions of infinite importance for this as for all other
states, we almost lose sight of the affair of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
Divorce, which had
been the original cause of quarrel, and which had meanwhile moved on in
the direction given it once for all. Pope Clement restrained himself as
much as possible, he still more than once made advances to the King and
offered him conciliatory terms; but the King had already gone too far in
his separation from Rome to be able to accept them. At the beginning of
1533 he celebrated his marriage with Anne Boleyn privately. He had once,
when he was still waiting for the Pope's decision, tried to influence it
by favourable opinions of learned
theologians.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>
With this view he
had applied to the most distinguished universities in Italy and Germany,
in France and in England itself; and managed to obtain a large number of
decisions, by which the Pope's right of dispensation was denied; and
this in spite of the constant efforts in various ways of the Imperial
agents; even the two mother-universities, Bologna and Paris, had
declared in his favour. He protested that he had been thereby enabled in
his conscience to free himself from the yoke of an unlawful union,
bordering on incest, and to proceed to another marriage. But all the
more urgent was it that the legality of this marriage should be
recognised according to the forms at that time lawfully valid. He no
longer wished for a recognition from the Pope; he laid the question
before the two Convocations of the English Church-provinces. For the
general course of Church history we must admit it to be an event of the
highest significance, that they dared to pronounce the dispensation of
Pope Julius II invalid according to God's law. The authority hitherto
regarded as the expression of God's will on earth was found guilty, by
the representatives of the Church of one particular country, of
transgressing that will. It now followed that the King's marriage,
concluded on the strength of that dispensation, was declared by the
Archbishop's court at Canterbury null and void, and invalid from the
beginning. Catharine was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
henceforth to be treated no longer as Queen
but only as still Princess-dowager.</p>

<p>She was unable to realise the things that were happening around her.
That she was expected to renounce her rank as Queen awoke in her quite
as much astonishment as anger. 'For she had not come to England,' she
said, 'on mercantile business at a venture, but according to the will of
the two venerated kings now dead: she had married King Henry according
to the decision of the Holy Father at Rome: she was the anointed and
crowned Queen of England; were she to give up her title, she would have
been a concubine these twenty-four years, and her daughter a bastard;
she would be false to her conscience, to her own soul, her confessor
would not be able to absolve her.' She became more and more absorbed in
strict Catholic religious observances. She rose soon after midnight, to
be present at the mass; under her dress she wore the habit of the third
order of S. Francis; she confessed twice and fasted twice a week; her
reading consisted of the legends of the saints. So she lived on for two
years more, undisturbed by the ecclesiastico-political statutes which
passed in the English Parliament. Till the very end she regarded herself
as the true Queen of England.</p>

<p>Immediately after the sentence on Catharine followed Anne's coronation,
which was performed with all the ancient ceremonial, all the more
carefully attended to because she was not born a princess. On the
Thursday before Whitsuntide she was escorted from Greenwich by the Mayor
and the Trades of London, in splendidly adorned barges, with musical
instruments playing, till she was greeted by the cannon of the Tower.
The Saturday after she went in procession through the City to
Westminster. The King had created eighteen knights of the Order of the
Bath. These in their new decorations, and a great part of the nobility,
which felt itself honoured in Anne's elevation, accompanied
her:<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>
she sat on a splendid seat, supported by and slung between horses: the
canopy over her was borne by the barons of the Cinque Ports;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
her hair was uncovered, she was charming as always, and (it appears) not without
a sense of high good fortune. On Sunday she was escorted to Westminster
Abbey by the Archbishop of Canterbury and six bishops, the Abbot of
Westminster and twelve other abbots in full canonicals: she was in
purple, her ladies in scarlet, for so old custom required; the Duke of
Suffolk bore the crown before her, which was placed on her head by the
hands of the archbishop. Nobles and commons greeted her with emulous
devotion, the ecclesiastics joined in; they expected from her an heir to
England.&mdash;Not a son, but a daughter, Elizabeth, did she then bear
beneath her heart.</p>

<p>Anne's coronation was at the same time the complete expression of the
revolt of the nation collectively from the Roman See: it is noteworthy
that Pope Clement VII, in his all-calculating and temporising policy,
even then reserved to himself the last word. As he had once yielded to
the Emperor, to conclude his peace with him, so now again&mdash;for he did
not wish to be entirely dependent on him&mdash;he had entered into close
relations with King Francis, who on his side saw in the continuance of
his union with England one of the conditions of his position in Europe.
The political weight of England reacted indirectly on the Pope: he
indeed annulled Archbishop Cranmer's decision, but he could not yet
bring himself to take a further step, often as he had promised the
Emperor and pledged himself in his agreements to do
so.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>
Charles V supplied his ambassador at Rome with yet another means to advance (as he
expressed himself) the decision of the proceedings with the Pope and
with the Holy See&mdash;for he made a distinction between them. The Pope
inquired of him what, after this had ensued, would then be done to carry
it out. The Emperor answered, his Holiness should do what justice
pledged him to do, what he could not omit if he would fulfil his duty to
God and the world, and maintain his own importance; this must come
first, the Church must use all its own means before it called in the
temporal arm: but if the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
matter came to that point, he would not fail
to do his part; to declare himself explicitly beforehand might excite
religious scruples.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>
And however much the policy of the Pope might
waver, there could be no doubt about the decision of the Rota. On the 23
March 1534 one of the auditors, Simonetta, bishop of Pesaro, made a
statement on the subject in the consistory of the cardinals: there were
only three among them who demanded a further delay: all the rest joined
without any more consideration in the decision that Henry's marriage
with Catharine was perfectly lawful, and their children legitimate and
possessed of full rights. The Imperialists held this to be a great
victory, they made the city ring with their cries of 'the Empire and
Spain':<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>
yet even then the French did not give up the hope of
bringing the Pope to another mind. But meanwhile in England the last
steps were already taken.</p>

<p>King Henry reckons it as honourable to himself that he had not yielded
to the offer of the Roman Court, made to him indirectly, to decide in
his favour, but had set himself against its usurped jurisdiction,
without being influenced by the
proposal,<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>
not for himself alone but
in the interest of all kings. Yet once more had he laid the question
before learned ecclesiastics, whether the Pope of Rome had any authority
in England by divine right; as the University of Oxford declares, their
theologians had searched for this through the books of Holy Scripture
and its most approved interpreters; they had compared the places,
conferred with each other on them and come at last to the conclusion, to
answer the King's question unreservedly in the negative. The Cambridge
scholars and both Convocations declared themselves in the same sense. On
this the Parliament had no scruple in abrogating piece by piece the
hierarchic-Romish order of things; it was nothing but a revocable right
which they had hitherto <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>borne with. The Annates were transferred to the
crown; never more was an English bishop to receive his pallium from
Rome. It was made penal to apply for dispensing faculties; with their
abolition the fees usually paid for them also ceased. The oldest token
of the devotion of the Anglo-Saxon race to the Roman See, the Peter's
penny, was definitely abolished. Care was taken that for the appeal in
the last resort, hitherto made to the Roman courts, there should be a
similar court at home. On the other hand the King granted a greater
freedom in the election of bishops, at least in its outward forms. The
existing laws against heretics were confirmed, though those independent
proceedings of the bishops which had been usual in the times of the
Lancasters received some limitation. For the episcopal constitution and
the old doctrine were to be retained: the wish was to establish an
Anglo-Catholic Church under the supremacy of the crown. The King added
to his titles the designation of 'Supreme Head on earth of the Church of
England immediately under God.' The Parliament awarded him the right of
Visitation over the Church in reference to abuses and even to errors, as
well as the right of reforming them. For the exercise moreover of the
Papal authority, which so far passed over to him, he had an example
before him which he had only to follow. Wolsey for a series of years, as
Legate of the Pope and then as his Vicar General, had administered the
English Church by means of English courts: the unity of the English
common-weal had been represented in his twofold power as legate and
first minister; practically it was no violent change when the King
himself now appointed a Vicar General who, empowered by him, exercised
this authority without any reference to the Pope. It was an assistant of
Wolsey, Thomas Cromwell, who was at the same time Keeper of the Great
Seal, who regulated the management of these affairs in a way not
altogether new to him. From this point of view Wolsey represents exactly
the man of the transition, who occupied the intermediate position in
nationalising the English Church.</p>

<p>Though Henry VIII did not always follow in his father's footsteps, he
was yet his genuine successor in the work he began. What the first Tudor
achieved in the temporal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span> domain, viz. the exclusion of foreign
influence, that the second extended to spiritual affairs. The great
question now was, whether the conflicting elements, in themselves
independent but ceaselessly agitated by their connexion with the rest of
Europe, would continue loyal to the idea of the common-weal; then even
their opposition might become a new impulse and help to perfect the
power of the State and the Constitution. </p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class='centersm'><a name="BII_V" id="BII_V"></a>
THE OPPOSING TENDENCIES WITHIN THE SCHISMATIC STATE.</p>

<p>Among the results of these transactions in England that which most
directly concerned the higher interests of the nation was the abolition,
by a formal decision of Parliament, on religious grounds, of the
hereditary title of the King's daughter by his Spanish Queen, and the
recognition of the succession of Queen Anne's issue to the throne, even
in the case of her having only the one daughter who had been meanwhile
born. This does not depend so much on the actual measures taken as on
the fact, that now, according to Wolsey's plan, the government had
broken with the political system which had prevailed hitherto, and
indeed in a sense that went far beyond his views. Not merely was a
French alliance avoided; the separation from the Church of Rome was to
become the basis of the whole dynastic settlement of England.</p>

<p>At home men felt most the harshness and violence of basing a political
rule on Church ideas. The statute contains threats of the sharpest
punishments against all who should do or write or even say anything
against it: a commission was appointed, in which we find the Dukes of
Norfolk and Suffolk, which could require every one to take an oath of
conformity to it. It was to be carried out with the full weight of
English adherence to the law.</p>

<p>It was to this very statute that Bishop Fisher of Rochester and Sir
Thomas More fell victims. They did not refuse to acknowledge the order
of succession itself thus enacted, for this was within the competence of
Parliament, but they would not confirm with their oath the reason laid
down in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
statute, that Henry's marriage with Catharine was against
Scripture and invalid from the beginning. More ranks among the original
minds of this great century: he is the first who learnt how to write
English prose; but in the great currents of the literary movement he
shrank back from the foremost place: after he had aided them by writings
in the style of Erasmus, he set himself as Lord Chancellor of England to
oppose their onward sweep with much rigour: he would not have the Church
community itself touched. Of the last statute he said, it killed either
the body if one opposed it, or the soul if one obeyed: he preferred to
save his soul. He met his death with so lively a realisation of the
future life, in which the troubles of this life would cease, that he
looked on his departure out of it with all the irony which was in
general characteristic of him. The fact that the Pope at this moment had
named Bishop Fisher cardinal of the Roman Church seems to have still
more hastened his execution. They both died as martyrs to the ideas by
which England had been hitherto linked to the Church community of the
West and to the authority of the Papacy.</p>

<p>If we turn our eyes abroad, the succession statute above all must have
made a most disagreeable impression on the Emperor Charles V. He saw in
it a political loss, an injury to his house, and indeed to all sovereign
families, and a danger to the Church. With a view to opposing it, he
formed the plan of drawing the King of France into an enterprise against
England. He proposed to him the marriage of his third son, the Duke of
Angoulême, with the Princess Mary, who was recognised as the only lawful
heiress of England by the Apostolic See, and whose claims would then
accrue to this
prince.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>
And they would not be difficult, so he said,
to establish, as a great part of the English abhorred the King's
proceedings, his second marriage, and his divergence from the Church. At
the same time the Emperor proposed the closest dynastic union of the two
houses by a double marriage of his two children with a son and a
daughter of Francis I. What in the whole world would he not have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
attained, if he had won over France to himself! His combination embraced
as usual West and East, Church and State, Italian German and Northern
affairs.</p>

<p>Perhaps the success of such a scheme was not probable; but independently
of this, Henry VIII had good cause to prepare himself to meet the
superior power of the Emperor, with whom he had so decidedly broken. As
we have already hinted, he could have no want of allies in this
struggle. It was under these circumstances that he entered into
relations with the powerful demagogues who were then from their central
position at Lubeck labouring to transform the North, and to sever it
from all Netherlandish-Burgundian influence. But it was of still more
importance to him to form an alliance with the Protestant princes and
estates of Germany proper, who had gradually become a power in
opposition to Pope and Emperor. In the autumn of 1535 we find English
ambassadors in Germany, who attended the meeting of the League at
Schmalkald, and the most serious negociations were entered on. Both
sides were agreed not to recognise the Council which was then announced
by the Pope, for the very reason that the Pope announced it, who had no
right to do so. The German princes demanded an engagement that if one of
the two parties was attacked, the other should lend no support to its
enemy; for the King this was not enough; he wished, in case he was
attacked, to be able to reckon on support from Germany in cavalry,
infantry, and ships, in return for which he was ready to give a very
considerable contribution to the chest of the League. It was even
proposed that he should undertake the protection of the
League.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p>All this however was based on a presupposition, which could not but lead
the English to further ecclesiastical changes. It was not a schism
affecting the constitution and administration of justice, but a complete
system of dissentient Church doctrines, with which Henry VIII came in
contact. The German Protestants made it a condition of their alliance
with England, that there should be full agreement between them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span> as to
doctrine.</p>

<p>We may ask whether this was altogether possible.</p>

<p>If we compare the Church movements and events that had taken place
during the last years in Germany and in England, their great difference
is visible at a glance. In Germany the movement was theological and
popular, corresponding to the wants and needs of the territorial state;
in England it was juridico-canonical, not connected with appeals to the
people or with free preaching, but based on the unity of the nation.
Though the German Diet had for a moment inclined to the Reform and had
once even given it a legal sanction, it afterwards by a majority set
itself against it: to carry it through became now the part of the
minority, the Protesting party. In England on the contrary all proceeded
from the plan of the sovereign and the resolutions of Parliament, in
which the bishops themselves with few exceptions took part. Perhaps a
more deep-seated ground of difference may be that the German bishops
were more independent than the English, and that an Emperor was then
ruling who, being at the same time King of Spain and Naples, troubled
himself little about the unity of Germany in particular; while in
England a newly-formed strong political power existed which made the
national interests its own and upheld them on all sides.</p>

<p>Despite all this the English Schism had nevertheless a deep inner
analogy with the German Reformation.</p>

<p>From the beginning the dispute as to jurisdiction was based on the
historical point of view, on which Luther too laid much stress.
Standish, who has been already mentioned, derived the right to limit the
ecclesiastical prerogatives, from this among other grounds, that there
were Christian churches in which they were altogether rejected, for
instance the rule as to the celibacy of the clergy was not accepted by
the Greeks. He inferred too, that, as no one disputed the claim of the
Greek Church to be Christian, the conception of the universal Church
must be different from that which Romanism asserts. Both countries also
found the groundwork of the true church-community in Scripture. In the
chief instance before them, that of the divorce,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
the German theologians
were not of the same mind as the English; but both sides agreed in this,
that there was a revealed will of God, which the ecclesiastical power
might not contravene: the conviction took root that the Papacy did not
represent the highest communion of men with divine things, but that this
rested on the divine record alone. The use of Scripture had at last
influenced various questions in England also. For abolishing the Annates
it was argued that such an impost contradicts a maxim of the Apostle
Paul; for doing away the Papal jurisdiction, that no place of Scripture
justifies it. This is what was meant when the assertion that the Papacy
is of divine right was denied. This becomes quite clear when Henry VIII
instead of the previous prohibitions against distributing the Bible in
the vernacular gave his licence for it. As he once declared with great
animation, the advancement of God's word and of his own authority were
one and the same thing.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>
The engraved title-page of the translation
which appeared with his <i>privilegium</i> puts into his mouth the expression
'Thy word is a light to my feet.' The order soon followed to place a
copy of the Book of books in every church: there every man might look
into the disputed places, and convince himself, by this highest of
codes, as to the rightfulness of the procedure that had been chosen.</p>

<p>But then it was impossible to stop at mere divergences of jurisdiction.
The German interpretation of Scripture gained ground in every direction:
a theological school grew up, though only here and there, which adhered
to it more or less openly.</p>

<p>It must needs have had the greatest effect, that the followers of this
view obtained a great number of bishoprics. The archbishopric of
Canterbury had already fallen to the lot of a man who had completed his
theological training in Germany: this very man, Thomas Cranmer, had
carried through the divorce; his was one of those natures which must
have the support of the supreme power to help them to follow out their
own views; as they then appear enterprising and courageous,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
so do they
become pliant and yielding when this favour fails them; they do not
shine through moral greatness, but they are well suited to preserve,
under difficult circumstances, what they have once embraced, for better
times. Hugh Latimer was cast in a sterner mould; he actually dared, in
the midst of the persecutions, to admonish the King, whose chaplain he
was, of the welfare of his soul and his duty as King. However little
this act effected for the moment, yet he may have thus contributed to
enlighten the King (who now and then showed him personal goodwill) as to
his title of 'Defender of the Faith.' Latimer was a fervent and
effective preacher: he was made bishop of Worcester. Nicolas Shaxton,
Bishop of Salisbury, Hilsey of Rochester, Bisham of S. Asaph's and then
S. David's, Goodrich of Ely, were all disposed to Protestantism. Edward
Fox who had been named Bishop of Hereford, had at Schmalkald openly
declared the Pope to be Antichrist, and assured the Protestants in the
strongest manner of his sovereign's inclination to attach himself to
their Confession. It was the grand union of these biblical scholars
among the bishops, which in the Convocation of 1536 undertook to carry
through the work of drawing their church nearer that of Germany. Latimer
opened the war by a fervent sermon against image-worship, indulgences,
purgatory, and other doctrines or rites which were at variance with the
Bible. Cranmer proved that Holy Scripture contains all that is necessary
for man to know for the salvation of his soul, and that tradition is not
needed. The Bishop of Hereford communicated it, as an experience of his
journey, that the laity everywhere would now be instructed only out of
the Revelation. Thomas Cromwell, who took part in the sittings as the
King's representative, lent them much support, and once brought with him
a Scottish scholar who had just returned from Wittenberg, to combat the
received doctrine of the
Sacrament.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>
On the other side also stood
men of weight and consideration, Lee archbishop of York who had
expressly opposed himself, together with his clergy, to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
adoption of the King's new title, Stokesley of London who broke a lance for the
seven sacraments, Gardiner of Winchester and Longland of Lincoln who
after contributing materially to the King's divorce nevertheless
rejected any alteration in doctrine, Tonstall of Durham, Nix of Norwich.</p>

<p>It seems as though the King, who was still busied in the Parliament
itself with the confirmation of his church regulations, thought he
detected in this party too much predilection for the Papacy. He found
another motive in the necessity of having allies for the coming Council;
he decisively took the side of Reform. Ten articles were laid before the
Convocation in his name, the first five of which are taken from the
Augsburg Confession or from the commentaries on it; as to these the
Bishop of Hereford agreed with the theologians of Wittenberg. In them
the faithful were referred exclusively to the contents of the Bible, and
the three oldest creeds; only three sacraments were still recognised,
Baptism, Penance, and the Lord's Supper. The real presence was
maintained in them, in the words of those commentaries, and entirely in
Luther's original
sense.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>
But still this tendency was not yet so
strong as to be able to make itself exclusively felt. In the following
articles, the veneration, even the invocation, of saints, and no small
part of the existing ceremonies, were allowed&mdash;though in terms which
with all their moderation cannot disguise the rejection of them in
principle. Despite these limitations the document contains a clear
adoption of the principles of religious reform as they were carried out
in Germany. It was subscribed by 18 bishops, 40 abbots and priors, 50
members of the lower house of Convocation: the King, as the Head of the
Church, promulgated it for general observance. His vicegerent in Church
affairs commanded all the clergy entrusted with a cure of souls to
explain the articles, and also at certain times to lay before the people
the rightfulness of the abrogation of Papal authority. He required them
to give warnings against image-worship, belief in modern miracles, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
pilgrimages. Children were henceforth to learn the Lord's Prayer, the
articles of the Creed, and the Ten Commandments in
English.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>
It was the beginning of the Church service in the vernacular, which was rightly
regarded as the chief means of withdrawing the national Church from
Romish influence.</p>

<p>But Cromwell was also engaged in another enterprise, not less hostile
and injurious to the Papacy.</p>

<p>As many of the great men in State and Church thought, so thought also
the pious members of the monasteries and cloistered convents; they
opposed the Supremacy, not as they said from inclination to
disobedience, but because Holy Mother Church ordered otherwise than King
and Parliament ordained.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>
The apology merely served to condemn them.
In the rules they followed, in the Orders to which they belonged, the
intercommunion of Latin Christianity had its most living expression; but
it was exactly this which King and Parliament wished to sever. Wolsey
had already, as we know, and with the help of Cromwell himself, taken in
hand to suppress many of them: but in the new order of things there was
absolutely no more place for the monastic system; it was necessarily
sacrificed to the unity of the country, and at the same time to the
greed of the great men.</p>

<p>But it cannot be imagined that innovations which struck so deep could be
carried through without opposition. After all the efforts of the old
kings to establish Christianity in agreement with Rome, after the
victories of the Papacy when the kings quarrelled with it, and the
violent suppression of all dissent, it was inevitable that the belief of
the hierarchic ages, which is besides so peculiarly adapted to this end,
had in England as elsewhere sunk deep into men's minds, and in great
measure still swayed them. Was what had been always held for heresy no
longer to merit this name because it was avowed by the ruling powers? In
the northern counties neither the clergy nor the people would hear of
the King's supremacy; they continued to pray for the Pope;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
Cromwell's injunctions were disregarded. It may be that horrible abuses and vices
were prevalent in the cloisters, but all did not labour under such
reproaches; many were objects of reverence in their own districts, and
centres of hospitality and charity. It would have been wonderful if
their violent destruction had not excited popular discontent. And this
temper was shared by those who enjoyed the chief consideration in the
provinces. Among the nobles there were still men like Lord Darcy of
Templehurst, who had borne arms against the Moors in the service of
Isabella and Ferdinand: how offensive to them must innovations be which
ran counter to all their reminiscences! The lords in these provinces
were believed to have pledged their word to each other to suppress the
heresies, as they called the Protestant opinions, together with their
authors and abettors. The country people, who apprehended yet further
encroachments, were easily stirred up to commotion; collections of money
were made from house to house, and the strongest men of each parish
provided with the necessary weapons: in the autumn of 1536 open revolt
broke out. A lawyer, Robert Aske, placed himself at its head; he set
before the people all the damage that the suppression of the monasteries
did to the country around, by diverting their revenues and abstracting
their treasures. In a short time he had gained over the whole of the
North. The city of York joined him; Darcy admitted him into the strong
castle of Pomfret: in that broad county only one single castle still
held out in its obedience to the government: then the neighbouring
districts also were carried away by the movement: Aske saw an army of
thirty thousand men around him. He took the road to London to, as he
said, drive base-born men out of the King's council, and restore the
Christian church in England: he called his march a 'Pilgrimage of
Grace.' But when he came into contact with royal troops at Doncaster he
paused; for it was not a war, which would cost the country too dear, but
only a great armed remonstrance in favour of the old system that he
contemplated. He contented himself with presenting his
demands&mdash;suppression of heresies, restitution of the supreme charge of
souls to the Pope, restoration of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
the monasteries, and in particular
the punishment of Cromwell with his abettors, and the calling of a
Parliament.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>When we consider that Ireland was in revolt, Cornwall in a state of
ferment, men's Catholic sympathies stirred up by foreign princes, it is
easy to understand how some voices in the King's Privy Council were
raised in favour of concession. Henry VIII, a true Tudor, was not the
man to give in on such a point. He upbraided the rebels in haughty words
with their ignorance and presumption, and repeated that all he did and
ordered was in conformity with God's law and for the interests of the
country; but it was mainly by promising to call a Parliament at York
that he really laid the gathering storm. But at the first breach of the
law that occurred he revoked this
promise;<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>
if he had relaxed the
maintenance of his prerogative for a moment, he exercised it immediately
after all the more relentlessly. He at last got all the leaders of the
revolt into his hands, and appeared to the world to be conqueror. But we
cannot for this reason hold that the movement did not react upon him.
His plan was not, and in fact could not be, to incur the hostility of
his people or endanger the crown for the sake of dogmatic opinions.
True, he held to his order that the Bible should be promulgated in the
English tongue, for his revolt from the hierarchy, and demand of
obedience from all estates, rested on God's written word: nor did he
allow himself to swerve from the legally enacted suppression of the
monasteries; but he abandoned further innovations, and an altered
tendency displayed itself in all his proclamations. Even during the
troubles he called on the bishops to observe the usual church
ceremonies: he put forth an edict against the marriage of priests
(although he had been inclined to allow it) from regard to popular
opinion. The importation of books printed abroad, and any publication of
a work in England itself without a previous censorship, were again
prohibited. Processions, genuflexions, and other pious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
usages, in church and domestic life, were once more recommended. The sharpest
edicts went forth against any dissent from the strict doctrine of the
Sacrament and against any extreme variations in doctrine. The King
actually appeared in person to take part in confuting the misbelievers.
He would prove to the world that he was no heretic.</p>

<p>It had also already become evident that no invasion by the Emperor was
at present impending. Soon after his overtures to the King of France,
Charles V perceived that he could not win him over to his side. In the
Spanish Council of State they took it into consideration that Henry
VIII, if anything was undertaken against him, would at all times have
the King of France on his side, and in his passionate temperament might
be easily instigated to take steps which they would rather
avoid.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>
After Catharine's death they made mutual advances, which it is true did
not bring about a good understanding, but yet excluded actual
hostilities. It would only disturb our view if we were here to follow
one by one the manifold fluctuations in the course of these political
relations and negociations. One motive in favour of peace under all
circumstances was supplied by the ever-growing commerce between England
and the Netherlands, on which the prosperity of both countries depended,
and the destruction of which would have been injurious to the sovereigns
themselves. When, some time after, the prospect of an alliance with
France against England was presented to him by the interposition of the
new Pope, Paul III, Charles declined it. He remarked that the German
Protestants, to whom his attention must be mainly directed, would be
strengthened by
it.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>
At the most an interruption of this system
could only be expected in case civil disturbances in England invited the
Emperor to make a sudden attack. Once it even appeared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
as if a Yorkist movement might be combined with the religious agitation. A descendant of
Edward IV, the Marquis of Exeter, formed the plan of marrying the
Princess Mary, and undertaking the restoration of the old church system.
He found much sympathy in the country for this plan; the co-operation of
the Emperor with him might have been very dangerous.</p>

<p>Henry lost no time in fortifying the harbours and coasts against such an
attack.</p>

<p>But the chief means of preventing all dangers of this kind lay in
cutting from under them the ground on which they rested. Henry VIII was
not minded to yield a jot of the full power he had inherited: on the
contrary his supremacy in church matters was confirmed in 1539 by a new
act of Parliament: another finally ordained the suppression of the
greater abbeys also, whose revenues served to endow some new bishoprics,
but mainly passed into the possession of the Crown and the Lords: the
unity of the Church and the exclusive independence of the country were
still more firmly established. But the more Henry was resolved to abide
by his constitutional innovations, the more necessary it seemed to him,
in reference to doctrine, to avoid any deviation that could be
designated as heretical. And though he some years before made advances
to the Protestants because he needed their support against the Emperor
and the Pope, things were now on the contrary in such a state that he
could feel himself all the safer, the less connexion he had with the
Germans. Under quite different auspices of home and foreign politics was
the religious debate, that had led in 1536 to the Ten Articles, resumed
three years later. The bishops who held to the old belief were as steady
as ever and, so far as we know, bound together still more closely by a
special agreement. They knew how to get rid of the old suspicion of
their having thought of restoring the Papal supremacy and jurisdiction,
by showing complete devotion to the King. On the other hand the
Protestants had suffered a very sensible loss in Bishop Fox of Hereford,
who had always possessed much influence over the King, but had died
lately. An understanding between the two parties on questions which were
dividing the whole world was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
not to be thought of; they confronted each
other as irreconcilable antagonists. The debates were transferred on
Norfolk's proposal to Parliament and Convocation; at last it was thought
best that each of the two parties should bring in the outline of a bill
expressing its own views. This was done: but first both bills were
delivered to the King, on whose word, according to the prevailing point
of view, the decision mainly depended. We may as it were imagine him
with the two religious schemes in his hand. On the one side lay
progressive innovation, increasing ferment in the land, and alliance
with the Protestants: on the other, change confined to the advantages
already gained by the crown, the contentment of the great majority of
the people, who adhered to the old belief, peace and friendship with the
Emperor. The King himself too had a liking for the doctrines he had
acknowledged from his youth. The balance inclined in favour of the
bishops of the old belief: Henry gave their bill the preference. It was
the bloody bill of the Six Articles, mainly, so far as we know, the work
of Bishop Gardiner of Winchester.</p>

<p>The doctrine of transubstantiation and all the usages connected with it,
private masses and auricular confession, and the binding force of vows,
were sanctioned anew; the marriage of priests and the giving the cup to
the laity were prohibited; all under the severest penalties. The whole
of the high nobility to a man agreed to it: the Lower House raised the
resolutions of the clergy into law.</p>

<p>How completely did the German ambassadors, who had come over with the
expectation of seeing the victory in England of the theologians who were
friendly to them, find themselves deceived! They still however cherished
the hope that these resolutions would never be carried out. Their ground
for hope lay in the King's marriage with a German Protestant princess,
which was just then being arranged.</p>

<p>Some years before Anne Boleyn had fallen a victim to a dreadful fate.
How had the King extolled her shortly before his marriage as a mirror of
purity, modesty and maidenliness! hardly two years afterwards he accused
her of adultery under circumstances which, if they were true, would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
make her one of the most depraved creatures under the sun. If we go
through the statements that led to her condemnation, it is difficult to
think them complete fictions: they have been upheld quite recently. If
on the other hand we read the letter, so full of high feeling and inward
truthfulness, in which Anne protests her innocence to the King, we
cannot believe in the possibility of the transgressions for which she
had to die. I can add nothing further to what has been long known,
except that the King, soon after her coronation, in November 1533,
already showed a certain discontent with
her.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>
Was it after all not
right in the eyes of the jealous autocrat that his former wife's lady in
waiting now as Queen wore the crown as well as himself? Anne Boleyn too
might not be without blame in her demeanour which was not troubled by
any strict rule. Or did it seem to the King a token of the divine
displeasure against this marriage also, that Anne Boleyn in her second
confinement brought a stillborn son into the world? It has been always
said that the lively interest she took in the progress of the outspoken
Protestantism, whose champions were almost all her personal friends,
contributed most to her fall. For the house from which she sprung she
certainly in this respect went too far. In the midst of religious and
political parties, pursued by suspicion and slander, and in herself too
tormented by jealousy, endangered rather than guarded by the possession
of the highest dignity, she fell into a state of excitement bordering on
madness.</p>

<p>On the day after her execution the King married one of her maids of
honour, the very same who had awakened her jealousy, Jane Seymour. She
indeed brought him the son for whom his soul longed, but she died in her
confinement.</p>

<p>In the rivalry of parties Cromwell after some time formed the plan of
strengthening his own side by the King's marriage with a German
princess; he chose for this purpose Anne of Cleves, a lady nearly
related to the Elector of Saxony, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
whose brother as possessor of
Guelders was a powerful opponent of the Emperor. This was at the time
when the Emperor on his way to the Netherlands paid a visit to King
Francis, and an alliance of these sovereigns was again feared. But by
the time his new wife arrived all anxiety had already gone by, and with
it the motive for a Protestant alliance for the King had ceased. Anne
had not quite such disadvantages of nature as has been asserted: she was
accounted amiable:<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>
but she could not enchain a man like Henry; he
had no scruple in dissolving the marriage already concluded; Anne made
no opposition: the King preferred to her a Catholic lady of the house of
Howard. But the consequent alteration was not limited to the change of a
wife. The hopes the Protestants had cherished now completely dwindled
away: it was the hardest blow they could receive. Cromwell, the person
who had been the main instrument in carrying out the schism by law, and
who had then placed himself at the head of the reformers, was devoted to
destruction by the now dominant party. He was even more violently
overthrown than Wolsey had been. In the middle of business one day at a
meeting of the Privy Council he was informed that he was a prisoner; two
of his colleagues there tore the orders which he wore from his person,
since he was no longer worthy of
them;<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>
that which had been the ruin
of so many under his rule, a careless word, was now his own.</p>

<p>Now began the persecution of those who infringed the Six Articles, on
very slight grounds of fact, and with an absence of legal form in
proving the cases, that held a drawn sword over innocent and guilty
alike. Bishops like Latimer and Shaxton had to go to the Tower. But how
many others atoned for their faith with their life! Robert Barnes, one
of the founders of the higher studies at Cambridge, well known and
universally beloved in Germany, who avowed the doctrines imbibed there
without reserve, lost his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
life at the stake. For what the peasants had
once demanded now again came to pass;&mdash;the heretics perished by fire
according to the old statutes.</p>

<p>After some time a check was given to extreme acts of violence. Legal
forms were supplied for the bloody laws, which softened their severity.
To Archbishop Cranmer, who was likewise attacked, the King himself
stretched out a protecting hand. When he once more made common cause
with the Emperor against France, and undertook a war on the Continent,
he previously ordered the introduction of an English Litany, which was
to be sung in processions. The fact that the Bible was read in the
vernacular, and popular devotional exercises retained in use, saved the
Protestant ideas and efforts, despite all persecution, from extinction.</p>

<p>It gives a disagreeably grotesque colouring to the government of Henry
VIII to see how his matrimonial affairs are mixed up with those of
politics and religion. Queen Catharine Howard, whose marriage with him
marked also the preponderance of the Catholic principle, was without any
doubt guilty of offences like those which were imputed to her
predecessor Anne: at her fall her relations, the leaders of the
anti-Protestant party, lost their position and influence at court. The
King then married Catharine Parr, who had good conduct and womanly
prudence enough to keep him in good temper and contentment. But she
openly cherished Protestant sympathies; and she was once seriously
attacked on their account. Henry however let her influence prevail, as
it did not clash with his own policy.</p>

<p>Now that once the sanctity of marriage had been violated, the place of
King's wife became as it were revocable; the antagonistic factions
sought to overthrow the Queen who was inconvenient to them; that which
has been at various times demanded of other members of the household,
that they should be in complete agreement with the ruling system, was
then required with respect to their wives, and indeed to the wife of the
sovereign himself; the importance of marriage was now shown only by the
violence with which it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span> dissolved.</p>

<p>This self-willed energetic sovereign however by no means so completely
followed merely his own judgment as has been assumed. We saw how after
Wolsey's fall he at first inclined to the protestant doctrines, and then
again persecuted them with extreme energy. He sacrificed, as formerly
Empson and Dudley, so Wolsey and now Cromwell to the public opinion
roused against them. He recognised with quick penetration successive
political necessities and followed their guidance. The most
characteristic thing is that he always seemed to belong body and soul to
these tendencies, however much they differed from each other: he let
them be established by laws contradictory to each other, and insisted
with relentless severity on the execution of those laws.</p>

<p>Under him, if ever, England appears as a commonwealth with a common
will, from which no deviation is allowed, but which moves forward
inclining now to the one side now to the other. It was no part of Henry
VIII's Tudor principles and inclinations to call the Parliament
together; but for his Church-enterprise it was indispensable. He gave
its tendencies their way and respected the opinion which it represented:
but at the same time he knew how to keep it at all times under the sway
of his influence. Never has any other sovereign seen such devoted
Parliaments gathered round him; they gave his proclamations the force of
law, and allowed him to settle the succession according to his own
views; they then gave effect to what he determined.</p>

<p>In this way it was possible for Henry VIII to carry through a political
plan that has no parallel. He allowed the spiritual tendencies of the
century to gain influence, and then contrived to confine them within the
narrowest limits. He would be neither Protestant nor Catholic, and yet
again both; an unimaginable thing, if it had only concerned these
opinions: but he retained his hold on the nation because his plan of
separating the country from the Papal hierarchic system, without taking
a step further than was absolutely necessary, suited the people's views.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
In the earlier years it appeared as though he would alienate Ireland by
his religious innovations, since there Catholicism and national feeling
were at one. And there really were moments when the insurgent chiefs in
alliance with Pope and Emperor boasted that with French and Scotch help
they would attack the English on all sides and drive them into the sea.
But there too it proved of infinite service to him that he defended
dogma while he abandoned the old constitution. In Ireland the
monasteries and great abbeys were likewise suppressed; the O'Briens,
Desmonds, O'Donnels, and other families were as much gratified as the
English lords and gentlemen with the property almost gratuitously
offered them. Under these circumstances they recognised Henry VIII as
King of Ireland, almost as if they had a feeling of the change of
position as regards public law into which they thus came: they received
their baronies from him as fiefs and appeared in Parliament.</p>

<p>Towards the end of his life Henry once more drew the sword against
France in alliance with the Emperor. What urged him to this however was
not the Emperor's interest in itself, but the support which the party
hostile to him in Scotland received from the French. Moreover he did not
trouble himself to bring about a decisive result between the two great
powers: he was content with the conquest of Boulogne. He had reverted to
his father's policy and resolved not to let himself be drawn over by any
of his neighbours to their own interests, but to use their rivalry for
his own profit and
security.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>And he was able to do yet more than his father to increase England's
power of defence against the one or the other. We hear of fifty places
on the coast which he fortified, not without the help of foreign
master-workmen: the two great harbours of Dover and Calais he put into
good condition and filled them with serviceable ships. For a long time
past he had been building the first vessels of a large size (such as the
Harry and Mary Rose) which then did service in the
wars.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>
It may be
that the property of the monasteries was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
partly squandered and ought to
have been better husbanded: a great part of their revenues however was
applied to this purpose, and conferred much benefit on the country so
far as its own peculiar interests were concerned.</p>

<p>The characteristic of his government consists in the mixture of
spiritual and temporal interests, the union of violence with fostering
care. The family enmities, which Henry VII had to contend with, are
combined with the religious under Henry VIII, for instance in the
Suffolk family: as William Stanley under the father, so Fisher and More
under the son, perished because they threw doubt on the grounds for the
established right, and still more because they challenged that right
itself. It raised a cry of horror when it was seen how under Henry VIII
Papists and Protestants were bound together and drawn to the place of
execution together, since they had both broken the laws. Who would not
have been sensible of this? Who would not have felt himself distressed
and threatened? Yet at the opening of the Session of 1542, after the
Chancellor had stated in detail the King's services (who had taken his
place on the throne), Lords and Commons rose and bowed to the sovereign
in token of their acknowledgment and gratitude. In the Session of 1545
he himself once more took up the word. In fatherly language he exhorted
both the religious parties to peace; a feeling pervaded the assembly
that this address was the last they would listen to from him; many were
seen to burst into tears.</p>

<p>For his was the strong power that kept in check the fermenting elements
and set them a law that might not be broken. On their antagonism, by
favouring or restraining them, he established his strong system of
public order. In Henry VIII we remark no free self-abandonment and no
inward enthusiasm, no real sympathy with any livi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>ng man: men are to him
only instruments which he uses and then breaks to pieces; but he has an
incomparable practical intelligence, a vigorous energy devoted to the
general interest; he combines versatility of view with a will of
unvarying firmness. We follow the course of his government with a
mingled sense of aversion and admiration. </p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p class='centersm'><a name="BII_VI" id="BII_VI"></a>
RELIGIOUS REFORM IN THE ENGLISH CHURCH.</p>

<p>The question arises, whether it was possible permanently to hold to
Henry's stand-point, to his rejection of Papal influence and to his
maintenance of the Catholic doctrines as they then were. I venture to
say, it was impossible: the idea involves an historical contradiction.
For the doctrine too had been moulded into shape under the influence of
the supreme head of the hierarchy while ascending to his height of
power: they were both the product of the same times, events, tendencies:
they could not be severed from each other. Perhaps they might have been
both modified together, doctrine and constitution, if a form had been
found under which to do it, but to reject the latter and maintain the
former in its completed shape&mdash;this was impracticable.</p>

<p>When it was seen that Henry could not live much longer, two parties
became visible in the country as well as at court, one of which, however
much it disguised it, was without doubt aiming at the restoration of the
Pope's supremacy, while the other was aiming at a fuller development of
the Protestant principle. Henry had settled the succession so that first
his son Edward, then his elder daughter (by his Spanish wife), then the
younger (by Anne Boleyn), were to succeed. As the first, the sovereign
who should succeed next, was a boy of nine, it was of infinite
importance to settle who during the time of his minority should stand at
the helm. The nearest claim was possessed by the boy's uncle on the
mother's side, Edward Seymour, Earl of Hertford, who had begun to play a
leading part in Henry's court and army, was in close alliance with Queen
Catharine Parr, and like her cherished Protestant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
sympathies. But the
Norfolks with their Catholic sympathies who had previously so long
exercised a leading influence on the government, would not give way to
him. Norfolk's son, the Earl of Surrey, adopted the immoral plan of
ensnaring the King, who though dying was yet supposed to be still
susceptible to woman's charms, by means of his sister, in order to draw
him back to the side of his family and the strict Catholics: a plot
which failed at once when his sister refused to play such a part. The
ambitious announcements into which he allowed himself to be hurried away
could only bring about the opposite result: he himself was executed, his
father thrown into prison, and the man who could have done most in the
Catholic direction, Bishop Gardiner, was struck out of the list of those
who, after the King's death, were to form the Privy
Council.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>
Immediately afterwards, January 1547, Henry died. He had composed the
Privy Council of men of both tendencies in the hope, as it appears, that
in this way his system would be most surely upheld. But men were too
much accustomed to see the highest power represented in one leading
personage, for it to continue long in the hands of a Board of
Councillors. From the first sittings of the Privy Council Edward VI's
uncle, the Earl of Hertford, came forth as Duke of Somerset and
Protector of the realm. In him the reforming tendency won the upper
hand.</p>

<p>It appeared at once with full force at the Coronation, which was not
celebrated at all after the form traced out by Henry VIII, since even
this would have tied them far too much to the existing system; Cranmer,
in the discourse which he there addressed to the young King, departed in
the most decided manner from all the ideas hitherto attached to a
coronation. Whither had the times of the first Lancaster departed, in
which a special hierarchic sacredness was given to the Anointing through
its connexion with Thomas Becket? Becket's shrine had been destroyed.
The present Archbishop of Canterbury went back to the earliest times of
human history: he brought forward the example of Josias, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
likewise came to the government in tender years and extirpated the worship of
idols: so might Edward VI also completely destroy image-worship, plant
God's true service, and free the land from the tyranny of the Bishop of
Rome; it was not the oil that made him God's anointed, but the power
given him from on high, in virtue of which he was God's representative
in his realm. His duty to the Church was changed into his duty to
religion: instead of upholding the existing state of things, it at once
pledges and empowers him to reform the
Church.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p>The great question now was, how an alteration could be prepared in a
legal manner, and how far it would be possible to maintain in this the
constitution of the realm in its relation to the states of Europe. On
the ground of the supremacy and of a precedent of Henry VIII, they began
with a resolution to despatch commissions throughout the realm, to
revive the suppressed Protestant sympathies; the precedent was found in
the ordinances that had once proceeded from Thomas Cromwell, just as if
they had not in the least been annulled by what had happened since, but
simply set aside by party feeling and neglect. They were to enquire
whether, as therein ordered, the bishops had preached against the Pope's
usurpation, the parish priests had taught men to regard not outward
observances but fulfilment of duty as the real 'good works,' and had
laboured to diminish feast-days and pilgrimages. Above all, images to
which superstitious reverence was paid were at last to be actually
removed: the young were to be really taught the chief points of the
faith in English, a chapter of the Bible should be read every Sunday,
and Erasmus' Paraphrase employed to explain it. In place of the sermon
was to come one of the Homilies which had been published under the
authority of the Archbishop and King. For this last ordinance also
authority was found in an injunction of Henry VIII. Archbishop Cranmer,
whose work they are, establishes in them the two principles, on which he
had already proceeded in 1536, one that Holy Scripture contains all that
it is necessary for men to know, the other that forgiveness of sins
depends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
only on the merits of the Redeemer and on faith in Him. On this
depends absolutely the possibility of rooting out of men's minds the
belief in the binding force of Tradition, and the hierarchic views as to
the merit of good works. The Archbishop's views were promoted by
eloquent and zealous preachers such as Matthew Parker, John Knox, Hugh
Latimer; more than all by the last, who had been released from the
Tower, weak in body but with unimpaired vigour of spirit. The fact of
his having maintained these doctrines in the time of persecution, his
earnest way and manner, and his venerable old age doubled the effect of
his discourses.</p>

<p>No direct alteration could be thought of so long as the Six Articles
still existed with their severe threats of punishment. In the Parliament
elected under the influence of the new government it needed little
persuasion to procure their repeal. The Protector assured the members
that he had been urgently entreated to effect this, since every man felt
himself endangered.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>One of those popular beliefs gained ground, which are often more
effective in great assemblies than elaborate proofs: the conviction that
doctrine and authority were too closely akin for the separation from
Rome to be maintained without deviation in doctrine; the breach must be
made wider if it was to continue, and the hierarchic doctrines give way.</p>

<p>So it came about that by a unanimous resolution of Convocation, which
Parliament confirmed, the alteration was approved, which almost more
than any other characterises those Church formularies that deviate from
the Romish, the administration of the communion in both kinds.</p>

<p>Now it was exactly from this that the transformation of the whole divine
worship in England proceeded. The very next Easter (1548) a new form for
the communion office was published in English. This was followed,
according to a wish expressed by the young King, by a Liturgy for home
and church use, in which the revised Litany of Henry VIII was also
included. In this 'Common Prayerbook' they everywhere
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
kept to what was before in use, but everywhere also made changes. The Reforming
tendencies obtained the upper hand in reference to its doctrinal
contents; thus even one of the rubrics previously in favour by which
auricular confession was declared to be indispensable was now omitted;
it was left to every man's judgment to avail himself of it or not. At
times they again sought out what had been disused in later ages: they
recurred to Anglo-Saxon usages. The Common Prayer-book is a genuine
monument of the religious feeling of this age, of its learning and
subtlety, its forbearance and decision. In the Parliament of 1549 it was
received with admiration: men even said it was drawn up under the
inspiration of the Holy Spirit. The order went forth for its adoption in
all churches of the land, no other liturgy was to be used; it has
nourished and edified the national piety of the English
people.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>And just as it was now asserted that in all this they were only carrying
out the views of the deceased King, as he had set them forth many years
before and had at the last again proclaimed them, so now Somerset
undertook to carry through another of his intentions as well, which was
closely connected with his religious plans.</p>

<p>In 1542 Henry VIII had agreed with some of the most powerful nobles of
Scotland that in that country too the Church should be reformed, all
relations with France broken off, and the young Queen brought to England
in order if possible to marry his son Edward at some future day. The
scheme broke down owing to all kinds of opposition, but the idea of
uniting England and Scotland in one great Protestant kingdom had thus
made its appearance in the world and could never again be set aside. The
ambition to realise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
it filled the soul of Somerset. When, before the
end of the summer of 1547, he took up arms, he hoped to bring about an
acknowledgment of England's old supremacy over Scotland, to prepare the
way for the future union of both countries by the marriage, and to
annihilate the party there which opposed the progress of Protestantism.
A vision floated before him of fusing both nations into one by a union
of dynasty and of creed. It was mainly from the religious point of view
that his ward regarded the matter. 'They fight for the Pope,' wrote
Edward to the Protector when he was already in the field, 'we strike for
the cause of God, without doubt we shall
win.'<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>Somerset had already penetrated far into the land when he offered the
Scots to retreat and make peace on the one condition that Mary should
marry Edward VI. But the ruling party did not so much as allow his offer
to be known. A battle took place at Pinkie, in which Somerset won a
brilliant victory. Not a little did this victory contribute to establish
his consequence in the world: even in Scotland some districts on the
borders took the oath of fidelity to King Edward. But in general the
antipathies of the Scotch to the English were all the more roused by it;
they would hear nothing of a wooing, carried on with arms in the hand:
the young Queen was after some time (August 1548) carried off to France,
to be there married to the Dauphin. The Catholic interests once more
maintained their ascendancy in Scotland over those of the English and
the Protestants.</p>

<p>And how could Somerset's plans and enterprises fail to meet with
resistance in England itself? All the elements were still in existence
that had once set themselves in opposition to King Henry with such
energy. When an attempt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
was made in earnest to carry out the
innovations at home, in the summer of 1549, the revolt burst into flame
once more.</p>

<p>In Cornwall a tumult arose at the removal of an image, and the King's
commissary was stabbed by a priest. The troubles extended to Devonshire,
where men forced the priests to celebrate the mass after the old ritual,
and then took the field with crosses and tapers, and carrying the Host
before them. When their numbers became so large as to embolden them to
put forth a manifesto, they demanded before all&mdash;incredible as it may
seem&mdash;the restoration of the Six Articles and the Latin Mass, the
customary reverence to the Sacrament and to images. They did not go so
far as to demand the restoration of the authority of the Roman See, like
the rebels under Henry VIII; but they pressed for a fresh recognition of
the General Councils, and of the old church laws as a whole. At least
half of the confiscated church property was to be given back, two abbeys
at least were to remain in each county. But this movement owed its
peculiar character to yet another motive. The enclosures of the arable
land for purposes of pasture, of which the peasantry had been long
complaining, did not merely continue; the nobility, which took part in
the secularisation of the church-lands in an increasing degree, extended
its grasp also to the newly-gained estates. So it came to pass that a
rising of the peasants against the nobles was now united with tendencies
towards church restoration, as in previous times with ideas of quite a
different kind. East and West were in revolt at one and the same time
and for different reasons. On a hill near Norwich, the chief leader, a
tanner by trade, called Ket, took his seat under a great oak which he
called the Oak of Reformation; he had the mass read daily after the old
use: but he also planned a remodeling of the realm to suit the views of
the people. The wildest expectations were aroused. A prophecy found
belief according to which monarchy and nobility were to be destroyed
simultaneously, and a new government set up under four Governors elected
by the common people. And woe to him who wished to reason with the
peasants against their design. They were already bending their bows
against a preacher who attempted to do so, he was only saved with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
difficulty. But they were still less capable this time of withstanding
the organised power of the State than they had been under Henry VIII. In
Devonshire they were beaten by Lord Russel, the ancestor of the Dukes of
Bedford; in Norfolk, where they had risen in the greatest force, by John
Dudley Earl of Warwick. Under his banners we find German troops as well,
who were untouched by the national sympathies, and in the rebels
combated only the enemies of Protestantism. The government obtained a
complete victory.</p>

<p>The insurrectionary movement was suppressed, but it once more produced a
violent reaction in home affairs, by which this time the head of the
government was himself struck
down.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>
Among English statesmen there
is none who had a more vivid idea of the monarchical power than the
Protector Somerset. He started from the view that religious and
political authority were united in the hand of the anointed King in
virtue of his divine right. The prayer which he daily addressed to God
is still extant; it is full of the feeling that to himself, as the
representative and guardian of the King, not only his guidance but also
the direction of all affairs is entrusted. Such was also the view of the
young sovereign himself. In one of his letters he thanks the Protector
for taking this employment on him, and for trying to bring his State to
its lawful obedience, the country to acknowledge the true religion, and
the Scots to submission. Somerset did not think himself bound by the
opinion of the Privy Council, since with him, and with no other, lay the
responsibility for the administration of the State. He held it to be
within his competence to remove at pleasure those of its members who
showed themselves adverse to him. He too had that jealousy of power,
which always directs itself against those who stand nearest to it. There
is no doubt that his brother, Thomas Lord Seymour, impelled by a
restless ambition, hoped to overthrow the existing government and put
himself in possession of the highest place, and committed manifold
illegal acts; he&mdash;the Lord Admiral of the realm&mdash;even entered into
alliance with the pirates in the
Channel.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>
But despite this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
it was thought at the time very severe when the Protector gave his word that
the vengeance of the law should be executed on his brother. His reason
was that Lord Seymour would not submit to sue in person for mercy to him
the injured party and possessor of power. Such were these men, these
brothers. The one died rather than pray for mercy: the other made the
bestowal of it depend on this prayer, this confession of his supreme
authority.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>
The Protector took all affairs, home and foreign,
exclusively into his own hand. Without asking any one, he filled up the
ministerial and civil posts: to the foreign ambassadors he gave audience
alone. He erected in his house a Court of
Requests,<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>
which encroached not a little on the business of Chancery. The palace in the
Strand, which still bears his name, was to be a memorial of his power;
not merely houses and gardens, but also churches which occupied the
ground, or from which he wished to collect his building materials, were
destroyed with reckless arbitrary power. Great historical associations
are indissolubly linked with this house. For it was Somerset after all,
who through personal zeal opened a free path for the Protestant tendency
which had originated under Henry VIII but had been repressed, and gave
the English government a Protestant character. He connected with this
not merely the Union of Scotland and England, but a yet further idea of
great importance for England itself. He wished to free the change of
religion from the antipathy of the peasantry which was at that time so
prominent. In the above-mentioned dissensions he took open part for the
demands of the commons: he condemned the progress of the enclosures and
gave his opinion that the people could not be blamed so heavily for
their rebellion, as their choice lay only between death by hunger and
insurrection. It seemed as though he wished in the next Parliament by
means of his influence to carry through a legal measure in favour of
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
commons.</p>

<p>But by this he necessarily awakened the ill will of the aristocracy. He
was charged with having instigated the troubles themselves by
proclamations which he issued in opposition to the Privy Council; and
with not merely having done nothing to suppress them but with having on
the contrary supported the ringleaders and taken them under his
protection.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>
No doubt this was the reason why the campaign against
the rebels in Norfolk was not entrusted to him, as he wished, but (after
some vacillation) to his rival, John Dudley, Earl of Warwick. The
victory gained by him, with the active sympathy of the nobility, which
was defending its own interests, was a defeat for Somerset. Even those
who did not believe that he had any personal share in the movement,
nevertheless reproached him with having allowed conditions to be
prescribed to himself and his government by the people; the common man
would be King. Financial difficulties arising from an alteration in the
coinage, and ill success in the war against France, contributed to give
his opponents the ascendancy in the Privy Council. Somerset once
entertained the idea of setting the masses in movement on his own
behalf: one day he collected numerous bands of people at Hampton Court,
under cover of summoning them to defend the King, by whose side his
enemies wished to set up a regency. But this pretext had little
foundation, it was only himself whom his rivals would no longer see at
the head of affairs: after a short fluctuation in the relations between
the main personages he was forced to submit. He saved his life for that
time: after an interval he was released from prison and again entered
the Privy Council: then he once more made an attempt to recover the
supreme power by help of the people, but thus drew his fate on himself.
The masses who regarded him as their champion showed him loud and
heartfelt sympathy at his execution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
On Somerset's first fall it was said that the Emperor Charles V had a
share in bringing it about, and this is very conceivable; for what
result could be more displeasing to this sovereign than that
Protestantism, which he was putting down in Germany, should have gained
at the same moment a strong position in England: it is certain that the
change of administration was greeted with joy by the court at
Brussels.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p>But it brought the Emperor no advantage. At the moment the new
government assumed a hostile attitude towards France: but soon
afterwards the Earl of Warwick, who now took the lead of affairs as Duke
of Northumberland, found himself driven to the necessity of making a
peace with that power, by which Boulogne was given up and Scotland
abandoned to French influence. One article of the treaty contains
indirectly a renunciation of the proposed marriage between the King of
England and the Queen of Scotland. And this treaty was greatly to the
Emperor's disadvantage, since it now set the French free to renew the
hostility against him which had been broken off some years before by an
agreement all in his favour. They allied themselves for this purpose
with the German princes who found the Emperor's yoke intolerable. These
princes had even applied to the English government: and Edward would
personally have been much inclined to lend an ear to their proposals. If
the fear of being involved in war with the Emperor on this account
withheld him from open sympathy, yet it is certain that his general
political attitude essentially contributed to enable them to take up
arms and break the Emperor's ascendancy.</p>

<p>Among the determining causes of a movement which is part of the history
of the world must be specially reckoned the personal disposition of this
prince, young as he was even at the close of his reign. Somerset had
kept him rather close: the Duke of Northumberland gave him greater
freedom, allowed him to manage his own money, and was pleased
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
when he made presents and showed himself as King; he was careful to see that
immediate obedience was paid
him.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>
Whilst Edward had been hitherto
almost exclusively busied with his studies, he now turned to knightly
exercises for which he also showed aptitude: he sat well on horseback,
drew his bow and broke his lance as well as any other young man of his
age. But with all this his learning was not
neglected.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>
Edward VI not merely possessed for his years extraordinary and manifold
attainments; the written remains which are extant from his hand display
a rare mental growth. What he has written for instance on his connexion
with the two Seymours, his uncles, indicates a clear and almost a
judicial conception of existing relations, which is very uncommon. On
his tutor's advice, to prevent his passing thoughts from getting
confused, he regularly noted them down, and composed a diary which has
the same characteristics and may be regarded as a valuable historical
monument. But studies and religion coincide in him: he is Protestant to
the core; his chief ambition is by means of his rank and power to place
himself at the head of the Protestant world. The duke could not have
ventured to oppose the progress of the Reformation.</p>

<p>In the days of distress, after the defeat in the Schmalkaldic war,
England was regarded as the refuge of the gospel: men welcomed the
scholars who fled thither, whose co-operation in the conflict with
Catholicism, still so powerful, was very desirable. In Cranmer's palace
at Lambeth were assembled Italians, French, Poles, Swiss, South Germans
and North Germans; the Secretary of State, William Cecil, who had been
trained in the service of the Protector, but had kept his place after
his fall, obtained them the King's support. Martin Bucer and Paulus
Fagius received promotion at Cambridge, Peter Martyr at Oxford: he there
maintained the Calvinistic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
views on the communion in a great
disputation. There were Walloon and French churches in the old centres
of Catholic worship, Canterbury and Glastonbury; John a Lasco preached
in the church of the Augustines in London. With no less vigour than
these foreigners did natives, sometimes returned exiles, maintain the
views then prevailing on the Continent. Under these influences it was
impossible, in conformity with the view taken up in 1536, to abide by
the dogmas, which had been put forth by the school of Wittenberg, now
completely overthrown. The difference comes out very remarkably when we
compare the Common Prayer-book of 1549 with the revised edition of 1552.
Originally men had held fast to the real presence in England also:
Cranmer in his catechism expressly declared for it: in the formula of
the first book, which was compiled out of Ambrose and Gregory, this view
was retained:<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>
but men in England had since convinced themselves
that this doctrine had not prevailed so exclusively in Christian
antiquity as had been hitherto thought: following the example of Ridley,
the most learned of the Protestant bishops, the majority had given up
the real presence: in the new Common Prayer-book a controversial passage
was even inserted against it. First on their own impulse, and then with
the help of the Privy Council, the zealous Protestant-minded bishops
removed the high altars from the churches and had wooden tables for the
communion put in their place: since with the word Altar was associated
the idea of Sacrifice.</p>

<p>It was now inevitable that the question from which all had started in
England, as to the relation between State and Church, should be decided
completely in favour of the secular principle. It is very true that
Cranmer held fast to the objective view of the visible church. If the
ceremonies were altered with which the Romish church imparts the
spiritual consecration, yet in this respect only the mystical usages
introduced in recent centuries were abandoned, and the ritual restored
to the form used in more primitive times, especially in the African
church. But it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
surely a violent change, when those who wished to
receive consecration were now previously asked, whether their inward
call agreed both with the will of the Redeemer and the law of the land;
they were required to assent to the principle that Scripture contains
all which it is necessary for man to know, and to pledge themselves to
guard against any doctrine not in conformity with Scripture. It is
generally believed, and the fact is of lasting importance, that the
Convocation of the clergy, a commission of the spiritualty, the
Primate-Archbishop and a number of bishops, took part in the change; but
yet the decisive decrees went forth from the Parliament, to which the
spiritual power had been irrevocably attached since Henry VIII, and
sometimes from the Privy Council alone. To establish a normal form of
doctrine, men set to work to compose a Confession, which was completed
at that time in forty-two Articles. There had been a wish that
Melanchthon should have come over in person to aid in composing it; at
any rate his labours had much influence in deciding the shape it took.
The Articles belong to the class of Confessions, as they were then
framed in Saxony by Melanchthon, in Swabia by Brenz, to be laid before
the coming Council. And it is just in this that their value lies, that
by them England attached herself most closely to the Protestant
community on the Continent. They are the work of Cranmer, who was
entrusted with their composition by the King and Privy Council, and
communicated his labours first to the King's tutor, Cheke, and the
Secretary of State, Cecil: in conjunction with them he next laid them
before the King; with the assistance of some chaplains their final form
was given them; then the Privy Council ordered them to be subscribed.
The influence of the government on the nominations to the office of
bishop was now still more open: the bishops were to hold office as long
as they conducted themselves well,&mdash;in other words, as long as the
ruling powers were content with them: the church jurisdiction was no
longer administered in the name of the bishopric, but, like the temporal
jurisdiction, in the King's name and under the King's seal; when they
proceeded to revise the church laws, the primary maxim was, not to admit
anything that contravened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
the temporal laws.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>
The use of the power of the keys was also derived by Cranmer from the permission of the
sovereign. Against this ever-increasing dependence some bishops of the
old views made a struggle; to avoid coming into direct conflict with the
supremacy, which they had acknowledged, they put forth the assertion
that it could not be exercised by a King under age; they connived at the
mass being read in side-chapels of their cathedrals, or refused to allow
the change of the altars into communion-tables, or kept alive the
controversy as to the doctrine of faith. The government on their side
persisted in enforcing uniformity. They brought all opponents before a
commission consisting of secular as well as ecclesiastical dignities,
which had no scruple in pronouncing the deprivation of the bishops: a
fate which befell Gardiner of Winchester, Bonner of London, Day of
Chichester, Heath of Worcester. In vain did they plead that the court
before which they were brought was not a canonical one; the government
appealed to the general rights of the temporal power as it had once been
exercised by the Roman Emperors. In the conflict of church opinions the
Protestant-minded prelates now had the upper hand. Many who did not
conform bought toleration from the government by sacrifices of money and
goods. Elsewhere the newly-appointed bishops assented to concessions
which did not always profit even the crown, but sometimes, as at
Lichfield, private persons.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>
Already the further question was
discussed whether there is in fact any essential distinction between
bishops and presbyters: a church of foreigners was set up in London, to
present a pattern of the pure apostolic constitution as an example to
the country. The government which had acquired such a thorough mastery
over the clergy developed an open disinclination to the old forms of
constitution in the church. Who could have said, so long as things
remained in the path thus once entered upon, whither this would lead?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p class='centersm'><a name="BII_VII" id="BII_VII"></a>
TRANSFER OF THE GOVERNMENT TO A CATHOLIC QUEEN.</p>

<p>We can easily see how the power of the crown, founded by the first
Tudor, and developed by the second through the emancipation from the
Papacy, was further strengthened under the third. From Edward VI we have
essays, in which he speaks about the spiritual and temporal government
with the consciousness of a sovereign, whose actions depend only on
himself. In the Homilies, which obtained legal sanction, there is found
an express condemnation of resistance to the King, 'for Godes sake, from
whom Kings are, and for orders sake.'</p>

<p>Whilst men were now expecting that Edward VI would arrive at manhood,
and take the government completely into his own hands, and conduct it in
the sense he had hitherto foreshadowed&mdash;not merely carrying out the
Reformation thoroughly at home, but assuming the leadership of the
Protestant world, symptoms appeared in him of the malady to which his
half-brother Richmond had succumbed at an early age. But how then if the
same fate befell him? According to Henry VIII's arrangement Mary was
then to ascend the throne who, through her descent from Queen Catharine
and from an inborn disposition which had become all the more confirmed
by her opposition to her father and brother, represented the Catholic
and Spanish interest. Nothing else could be expected but that she would
employ the whole power of the State in support of her own views, would,
so far as it could possibly be done, bring back the church to its
earlier form, would depress the men who had hitherto played a great part
by the side of the King and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
subject them to the opposite faction. But
were they quietly to acquiesce in their fate?</p>

<p>The ambition of the Duke of Northumberland associated itself with the
great interests of religion, to prevent the threatening ruin. He
persuaded the young King that it lay in his power to alter his father's
settlement of the succession, as in itself not conformable to law,
neither Mary nor the younger sister Elizabeth being entitled to the
throne, as the two marriages from which they sprang had been declared
illegal, and a bastard could not be made capable of wearing the English
crown by any act of Parliament. Henry VIII had in his settlement of the
succession passed over the descendants of his elder sister, married in
Scotland, as foreigners, but acknowledged those of the younger, Mary of
Suffolk, as the next heirs after his own children. Mary's elder daughter
Frances had married Henry Grey of Dorset, who had already obtained the
title of Suffolk, and had three daughters, the eldest of whom was Jane
Grey. It was to her, whom the Duke of Northumberland married to one of
his sons, that he now directed the King's attention, and induced him to
prefer her to his sisters. Yet it was not so much to herself in person
as to her male issue that Edward's attention was originally directed.
Never yet had a Queen ruled in England in her own right, and even now
there was a wish to avoid it. Edward arranged that, if he himself died
without male heirs, the male heirs of Lady Frances, and if she too left
none, then those of Lady Jane, should succeed. He hoped still to live
till such an heir should be eighteen years old, in which case he could
enter on the government immediately after himself. If his death occurred
earlier, Jane was to conduct the administration during the interval, not
as Queen but as Regent, and conjointly with a Council of government
still to be named by him.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>
This Council of executors was to avoid
all war, all other change, and especially not to alter the established
religion in any point: rather it was to devote itself to completing the
ecclesiastical legislation in conformity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
with that religion, and to the abolition of the Papal
claims.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>
We see that Edward's view was, like
that of many other sovereigns, to secure the continuance of his
political and religious system of government for long years after his
own death. The members of the Privy Council, before whom these
arrangements were laid in the King's handwriting, promised on their oath
and their honour to carry them out in every article, and to defend them
with all their power.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<p>And if the affair had been undertaken in this manner, who could say that
it might not have succeeded? Northumberland did not neglect to form a
strong family interest in favour of the new combination that he
designed. He married his own daughter to Lord Hastings, who was
descended from the house of York, and one of Jane's sisters with the son
of the powerful Earl of Pembroke. He could reckon on the support of the
King of France, to whom the succession of a niece of the Emperor was
odious, and on the consent of the Privy Council, which was in great part
dependent on him; how could the Protestant feeling have failed to gain
him a large party in the country, especially since something might be
said for the plan itself.</p>

<p>But Edward VI's malady developed quicker than was expected. At the last
moment he was further induced to award the succession not to the male
heirs of Lady Jane, but to herself and her male
heirs.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>
He died with the prayer that God would guard England from the Papacy.</p>

<p>Lady Jane Grey had hitherto devoted her days to study. For father and
mother were severe and found much in her to blame: on the other hand
quiet hours of inward satisfaction were given her by the instructions of
a teacher, always alike kindly disposed, who initiated her into learning
and an acquaintance with literature: bending over her Plato, she did not
miss the amusement of the chase which others were enjoying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
in the Park. After her marriage too, which did not make her exactly happy, she still
lived thus with her thoughts withdrawn from the world, when she was one
day summoned to Sion-House where she found a great and brilliant
assembly. She still knew nothing of the King's death. What were her
feelings, when she was told that Edward VI was dead; that to secure the
kingdom from the Popish faith and the government of his two sisters who
were not legitimate, he had declared her, Lady Jane, his heiress, and
when the great dignitaries of the realm bent their knees and reverenced
her as their Queen! At times they had already talked to her of her claim
to the throne, but she had never thought much of it. When it now thus
became a reality, her whole soul was overcome by it: she fell to the
ground and burst into a flood of tears. Whether she had a full right to
the throne, she could not judge: what she felt was her incapacity to
rule. But whilst she uttered this, a different feeling passed through
her, as she has told us herself: she prayed in the depths of her soul
that, if the highest office belonged to her legally, God might give her
the grace to administer it to his honour. The next day she betook
herself by water to the Tower, and received the homage offered her. The
heralds proclaimed her accession in the capital.</p>

<p>But here this proclamation was received in silence and even with
murmurs. The succession had been settled by Henry VIII on the basis of
an act of Parliament: nothing else was expected but that this would be
adhered to, and Mary succeed her brother: that Edward without any legal
authorisation of a similar kind had now put a distant relative in his
sister's place, seemed an open robbery of the lawful heir. It made no
impression, that at the proclamation men were reminded of the Popery of
the Princess Mary and her intention to restore the Papal power.
Religious discord had not yet become so strong in England as to make men
forget the fundamental principles of right on its account. The man who
brought the princess the first news of Edward's death (which was still
kept secret) remarks expressly in telling it, that he did not love her
religion but abhorred the attempt to set aside lawful heirs. Mary
prudently betook herself to Norfolk,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
where she had the most determined friends, to a castle on the sea; so as to be able, if her opponent
should maintain the upper hand, to escape to the Emperor. But every one
declared for her, the Catholics who saw in her the born champion of
their religion and were strongest in those very districts, and the
Protestants to whom the princess made some, though not binding,
promises; she was proclaimed Queen in Norwich. If the Duke of
Northumberland wished to carry out his projects, it was necessary for
him to suppress this movement by force. He at once took the field for
this purpose, with a fine body of artillery and two thousand infantry,
and occupied a position in the neighbourhood of Cambridge.</p>

<p>It seemed as though the crown would once more be fought for in open
field just as it had been a century before, and that in fact, just as
then, the neighbouring powers would interfere. On Northumberland's side
French help was expected; on the other hand application was already made
to the Emperor to send armed troops over the sea to his
cousin.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>
It was not however this time to reach such a point: while the combination
attempted in favour of Jane Grey met with strong popular resistance, it
was shattered to pieces by internal discord. If the new Queen had such a
good right as they told her, she would share it with none, not even with
her husband; she would not appear as a creature of the Dudleys and a
tool of their ambition: she would only name him a duke and would not
allow him to be crowned with her as King. We recognise in this her high
idea of the kingly power and its divine right; but we can also easily
conceive that the discord which broke out on this point in the family
could not but act on the members of the Privy Council, of whom only a
section were in complete understanding with Northumberland, while the
rest had merely yielded to the ascendancy of his power. While the duke
was expecting armed reinforcements from London, a complete revolution
took place there: under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
the management of the Privy Council Mary was
proclaimed Queen, and a summons sent to Northumberland to submit to her.
The fleet which was destined to prevent Mary's flight had already
declared for her; the troops which were called out in the counties to
fight against her crossed over to her side; in Northumberland's camp the
same opinion gained the upper hand: the duke felt himself incapable of
withstanding it: he allowed himself to be carried along by it like the
rest. Men saw the extraordinary spectacle of the man who had marched out
to destroy Mary now ordering her accession to be proclaimed in his
encampment, he accompanied the herald and himself cried out Mary's
name.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>
These English nobles have boundless ambition, they grasp with
bold hand at the highest prizes: but they have no inner power of
resistance, as against the course of events and public opinion they have
no will of their own. However the duke might behave, he could not save
either his freedom or his life. Soon afterwards Mary entered London amid
the joyous shouts of the people. She was still united as closely as
possible with her sister Elizabeth: they appeared together hand in hand.
Jane Grey remained as a prisoner in the Tower, which she had entered as
Queen. Never did the natural right of succession, as it was established
by the testator of the inheritance and the Parliament, obtain a greater
triumph.</p>

<p>After the succession was decided, the great questions of government came
into the foreground, above all the question what position Mary should
take up with regard to religious matters.</p>

<p>Among the Protestants the opinion prevailed that it could not yet be
known whether she would not let religion remain in the state in which
she found it. Towns where the Protestant feeling was strongest joyfully
attached themselves to her in this expectation.</p>

<p>Her cousin, the Emperor Charles, who justly regarded her accession as a
victory, and who from the first moment exercised the greatest influence
on her resolutions, advised her before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
all things to moderate her
Catholic zeal. She should reflect that many of the lords by whom she was
now supported, a part of the Privy Council, and the people of London,
were Protestants, and guard against estranging them. She should at once
call a Parliament to show that she meant to rule in the accustomed
manner, and take care that the Northern counties, as well as Cornwall,
where men still held the most firmly to Catholicism, were represented in
it.</p>

<p>This good advice was not without influence on the Queen. In a tumult
which arose two days after her arrival in the city, she had the Lord
Mayor summoned in order to tell him that she would force no man's
conscience, she hoped that the people would through good instruction
come back to the religion which she herself professed with full
conviction. When she repeated this soon after in a proclamation, she
added that these things must shortly be ordered by common consent. But
of what kind this order would be, there could be already no doubt after
these words: she desired a change, but intended to bring it about in a
legal manner.</p>

<p>In all the steps taken by her government her Catholic sympathies
predominated. She felt no scruple in using the spiritual rights, which
the constitution gave her, in favour of Catholicism. As 'Head of the
Church next under God,' Mary forbade all preaching and interpretation of
Scripture without special permission. But she entrusted the power of
giving this permission to the same Bishop Gardiner who had offered the
most persevering resistance to the Protestant tendencies of the previous
government. The antagonism between the bishops entered again on an
entirely new phase: the Catholics rose, the Protestants were depressed
to the uttermost. Tonstal, Heath, and Day were, like Gardiner, restored
to their sees on the ground of the protests lodged against the
proceedings taken with reference to them at their deprivation, protests
which were regarded as valid. Ridley had to give up the see of London
again to Bonner: the Bishops of Gloucester and Exeter experienced the
royal displeasure; not merely Latimer but also Cranmer were imprisoned
in the Tower. Everywhere the images were replaced, in many churches the
celebration of the mass was revived.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
Those preachers who declared
themselves against it had to follow their bishops to prison. The
Calvinistic model-congregation was dissolved. The foreign scholars
quitted the country; and their most zealous followers also fled to the
continent before the coming storm of persecution.</p>

<p>At the beginning of October the Queen's coronation took place with the
old customary ceremonies, for which the Emperor's leading minister,
Granvella, Bishop of Arras, sent over a vase of consecrated oil, on the
mystical meaning of which great stress was again laid. The Queen had
some scruples about the coronation, as she wished previously to get rid
of her title, 'Head of the Church': but the Emperor saw danger in delay;
he thought the declaration she had in the deepest secrecy made to the
Roman See, that she meant to re-establish its authority, removed any
religious scruple. He fully approved of the coronation preceding the
Parliament, and recommended the Queen, in virtue of her constitutional
right, without any delay to name bishops and prelates, who might be
useful to her at its impending meeting.</p>

<p>But the supreme power once constituted, as formerly in the civil wars,
so also in the times of the Reformation movement, had always exercised a
decisive influence on the composition of the Parliamentary assemblies;
would not this then be the case when it had declared itself again
Catholic? No doubt the government, at the head of which Gardiner
appeared as Lord Chancellor, used all the means at its disposal to guide
the elections according to its views. It appears to have been with the
same motive that the Queen in a proclamation, which generally breathed
nothing but benevolence, remitted payment of the subsidies last voted
under her brother. Yet we can hardly attribute the result wholly to
this. Parliamentary elections are wont to receive their impulse from the
mistakes of the last administration and the evils that have come to
light: and much had undeniably been done under Edward VI which could not
but call forth discontent. The ferment at home was increased by
financial disorder: church property had suffered enormous losses. But
above all the supreme power had taken a sudden start in breaking through
its ancient bounds. And, last of all, the Protestant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
tendencies had
allied themselves with an undertaking which ran directly counter to the
customary law and to previous Parliamentary enactments. And so it might
come to pass that the same feelings swayed the elections which had
mainly brought about Mary's accession.</p>

<p>But, after all, the result of these elections was not such as to make a
complete return to the Papal authority probable. The Emperor Charles,
who mainly guided the Queen's steps, warned her from attempting it. She
had prayed him to communicate to her the Pope's declarations issued in
favour of her hereditary right: he sent them to her, but with the advice
to make no use of them, since they might involve her in difficulties
without end. It seemed to him sufficient if the Parliament simply
repealed the enactments which had formerly been passed respecting the
invalidity of her mother's marriage with her father. In the bill which
was drawn up on this point in the Upper House it was merely stated that
the marriage, in itself valid and approved by the wisest persons of the
realm, had been made displeasing to the King through evil influences and
annulled by a sentence of Archbishop Cranmer, on whom the greatest blame
fell. To many men this seemed already going too far, since together with
the dispensation the old church authority was again recognised: but as
there was not a word about the Pope in it, this was less apparent: the
bill was passed unanimously. The act might be regarded as a political
one. On the other hand religion was very directly affected by the
proposal to repeal the alterations in the church service which had been
introduced under Edward VI, and to abolish the Common Prayer-book. On
this ensued the hottest conflict. Once the proposal had to be laid
aside: when it was resumed, the debate on it lasted six days: a third of
the members were steadily against it. But in the majority the opinion
again prevailed that Henry VIII's church constitution&mdash;retention of the
Catholic doctrines and emancipation from the Papacy&mdash;was the most
suitable for England: a resolution was carried to the effect that only
such books as were in use under Henry VIII should be henceforth used in
the church. The new forms of divine service, which contained a clearly
marked body of doctrine, were abolished and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
old ones restored.</p>

<p>The position which the Parliament took up in relation to another
scarcely less important question coincided with this sense of national
independence.</p>

<p>It was a very widespread wish in England that the Queen should give her
hand to young Courtenay, son of that Marquis of Exeter who had himself
once thought of marrying Mary against her father's wishes. He was a
young man of suitable age, handsome figure, and mental activity; Mary
had not merely freed him from the prison in which her brother had kept
him, but also endowed him with the Earldom of Devon, one of his father's
possessions; in this act many saw a token of personal inclination.
Bishop Gardiner was decidedly in his favour, and we can conceive how a
great ecclesiastic, who had the power of the state in his hands, wished
to altogether exclude every foreign influence; he of course knew that
Courtenay would also conform in church matters.</p>

<p>Gardiner spoke once with the Queen about it and was very pressing: she
was absolutely against it. The old chronicle is entirely in error when
it repeats the then widespread rumour of Mary's inclination for
Courtenay. Mary told the Imperial ambassador that she was altogether
ignorant of what love was; she had never seen Courtenay but once in her
life, at the moment when she released him. She intended to marry, since
she was assured that the welfare of the realm required it, but not an
Englishman, not one who was a subject. As in other things, so in this,
she requested the Emperor to give her his advice.</p>

<p>Charles V would not have been absolutely against the plan of his cousin
giving her hand to an English lord, whom England might obey more easily
than a stranger: but, when she showed such an aversion to it, he did not
hesitate for a moment as to what advice to give her. One of his
brother's sons was taken into consideration, but rejected by him on the
ground that there was already much ill-will against Spain stirring in
the Netherlands, and a union of the German line with England might some
day make it difficult for his own son to maintain those provinces: he
therefore proposed him to the Queen.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
Don Philip, not yet thirty but
already a widower for the second time, was just then negociating for a
marriage with a Portuguese princess. These negociations were broken off
and counter ones opened with England. Mary showed a joyful inclination
to it at the first word: it was to this that her secret thoughts had
turned.</p>

<p>It looked as if the dynastic union of the Burgundian-Spanish house with
the English, which was also a political alliance and had been violently
broken off at the same time with that alliance, would now be restored
more closely than before, and this time for ever. Men took up the idea
that Philip's eldest son was to continue the Spanish line, as Ferdinand
and his sons the German, but that from the new marriage, if it should be
blest with offspring, an English line of the house of Burgundy was to
proceed: a prospect of the extension of the power of England and of her
influence on the continent, which it was expected would set aside all
opposition.</p>

<p>In England however every voice was against it, among nobles and commons,
people and Parliament, high and low. The imperial court fully believed
that it was Gardiner who brought the matter forward in Parliament. The
House resolved to send a deputation to the Queen with the request that
she would marry an Englishman. Mary, who had as high an idea of her
prerogative as any of her predecessors or successors, felt herself
almost insulted; she interrupted the speech as soon as she understood
its purport, and declared that Parliament was taking too much on itself
in wishing to give her advice in this matter: only with God, from whom
she derived her crown, would she take counsel
thereon.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>
When the Parliament, not satisfied with this, prepared a fresh application to
her, it was dissolved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
But if this happened among men who adhered to her views in other
points, what would those say who saw themselves, contrary to their
expectation, oppressed and endangered by the Queen's measures in
religious matters?</p>

<p>The agitation was so general that men caught at the hope of putting an
end to all that was begun by a sudden rising. We find a statement which
must not be lightly rejected, that the English nobility, which had taken
great part in the Reformation movement and put itself in possession of
much church property, came to an understanding at Christmas 1553, and
decided on a general rising on the next Palm Sunday, 18th
March:<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>
thus doing as the French, German, Netherlandish and Scotch nobility had
done, who took the initiative in this matter. In Cornwall Peter Carew
was to have the lead, in the Midland Counties the Duke of Suffolk, in
Kent Thomas Wyatt. As the Queen's Privy Council was even now not
unanimous, they hoped to bring about an overthrow of the government
before it was yet firmly established: and either to compel the Queen to
dismiss her evil counsellors and give up the Spanish marriage, or if she
remained obstinate to put her sister Elizabeth in her place, who would
then marry Courtenay. The French, who saw in the Queen's marriage with
the prince of Spain a danger for themselves, urged on the movement, and
had a secret understanding with the rebels; their plan was to support it
by an incursion from Scotland where they were then the masters, and an
attack on Calais.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>
But as often happens with such comprehensive
plans, the government detected them; the attempt to carry them out had
to be made before the preparations were complete; in most of the places
where an effort was made it was suppressed without much trouble. Carew
fled to France; Suffolk, who in vain tried to draw Coventry over to his
side, was captured. On the other hand Sir Thomas Wyatt'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>s rising in Kent
was formidable. He collected a couple of thousand men, defeated the
royal troops, some of whom joined him, and as he had the sympathies of a
great part of the inhabitants of London with him, he attempted forthwith
an attack on the capital. But the new order of things had too firm a
legal foundation to be so easily overthrown. The Queen betook herself to
the Guildhall and addressed the assembled people, decided as she was and
confident in the goodness of her cause; the general feeling was in
favour of supporting her. All armed for defence. For a couple of days,
during which Wyatt lay before the city, every one was under arms, mayor,
aldermen and people; the lawyers went to the courts with armour under
their robes: priests were seen celebrating mass with mail under their
church vestments. The Queen had some trustworthy troops, whose leader,
the Earl of Pembroke, told her he would never show his face to her again
if he did not free her from these rebels. When Wyatt at last appeared in
Hyde Park with exhausted and badly fed men, he was met and beaten by an
overwhelming body of Pembroke's troops; with a part of his followers he
was driven into the city, and there made prisoner without much
bloodshed.</p>

<p>It has always been reckoned to the Queen's credit that amid the alarm of
these days she never quitted the unfortified palace. She had now an
opportunity to rid herself completely of Northumberland's faction. Jane
Grey, whose name at least had been mentioned, her father Suffolk, her
uncle Thomas Grey, were executed; Wyatt also and a great number of the
prisoners paid for their rebellion with their
lives.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p class='centersm'><a name="BII_VIII" id="BII_VIII"></a>
THE CATHOLIC-SPANISH GOVERNMENT.</p>

<p>The effort to overthrow Mary's throne had strengthened it: for the
second time she had rallied around it the preponderant majority of the
nation. And this was all the more surprising, since no one could doubt
any longer in what direction the Queen's exclusive religious views would
lead her. In her victory she saw a divine providence, by which it was
made doubly her duty to persevere, without looking back, in the path she
had once taken. In full understanding with her Gardiner proceeded
without further scruple, in the Parliament which met in April 1554, to
attempt to carry through the two points on which all else depended, the
abrogation of the Queen's spiritual title, which implied restoration of
the Pope's authority, and the revival of the old laws against heretics.
These views and proposals however met with unexpected opposition, both
in the nation, and no less in the Privy Council and Parliament,
especially in the Upper House. The lay lords did not wish to make the
bishops so powerful again as they had once been, and rejected the
restoration of the Pope's authority unless they previously had security
for their possession of the confiscated church property. The first
proposition could not, so far as can be seen, even be properly brought
forward:<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>
the second, the revival of the heresy laws, was accepted
by the Commons over whom Gardiner exercised great influence, but the
Peers threw it out. It was especially Lords Paget and Arundel who
opposed Gardiner's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
proposals in the Privy Council and the Lords and
caused their rejection.</p>

<p>Only in one thing were the two parties united, in recognising the
marriage contract concluded with Spain: it was passed unanimously by
Parliament.</p>

<p>In July 1554 Don Philip reached England with a numerous fleet, divided
into three squadrons, with a brilliant suite on board. At Southampton
the leader of one of the two parties, the Earl of Arundel, received him;
Bishop Gardiner, the leader of the other, gave the blessing of the
church to the marriage in Winchester cathedral. The day before the
Emperor had resigned the crown of Naples to his son, to make him equal
with the Queen in rank. How grand it sounded, when the king-at-arms
proclaimed the united titles: Philip and Mary, King and Queen of
England, France, Naples, Jerusalem, Ireland! A title with an almost
Plantagenet sound, but which now however only denoted the closest union
between the Spanish monarchy and the Catholics of England. Philip was
solicitous to gain over the different parties and classes of England:
for he had been told that England was a popular monarchy. He belied his
Spanish gravity and showed himself, despite the stiffness that was his
natural characteristic, affable to every man: he tried to make the
impression, and successfully, that he desired the prosperity of England.
One of the chief resources of the time, that of securing the most
considerable persons by means of pensions, he made use of to a great
extent. Both parties were provided for by annual payments and presents,
Pembroke and Arundel as well as Derby and Rochester. We are assured that
this liberality exercised a very advantageous influence on the
disposition of the country.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>
Gardiner looked on it as a slight, that
he was passed over in the list, for these pensions were considered at
that time an honour, but this did not prevent him from praising the
m<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>arriage in his sermons as ordained by heaven for the restoration of
religion.</p>

<p>All now depended on whether the King's influence would be sufficient to
carry at the next meeting of Parliament in November, the proposals which
had been rejected in the last session.</p>

<p>But for this, according to the view not merely of the English lords, but
of the imperial ambassador and of the Emperor himself, a previous
condition was indispensable. The English nobles must be relieved from
all apprehension lest the confiscated ecclesiastical property should
ever again be wrested from them. Cardinal Pole had been already for some
time residing in the Netherlands: but he was told that his arrival in
England would be not merely fruitless but detrimental unless he brought
with him a sufficient dispensation with regard to this. In Rome the
concession was opposed on the ground that it would be setting a bad
precedent. But when it was pointed out that the English confiscations
did not touch any church lands, but only monastic property, and still
more that without this concession the restoration of obedience to the
church could not be attained, Pope Julius III yielded to the request.
Two less comprehensive forms were rejected by the Emperor: at last one
was granted which would satisfy the English. The form of the absolution
which the Pope was to bestow after their submission was previously
arranged: it was agreed to avoid everything that could remind men of the
old pretensions and awaken the national antipathies.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the elections to Parliament were completed. The proclamation
issued gives the ruling points of view without reserve. An invitation to
elect Catholic members of merit was coupled with the assurance that
there was no intention of disturbing any kind of property. The means
lately used for preventing any hostile influence were not yet
sufficient: the advice was given from Brussels to go back to the older
and stricter forms.</p>

<p>The leading men of the Upper House were won over: there could be no
doubt about the tone of the Lower. At their first sitting a resolution
to release Cardinal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
Pole from the attainder that weighed on him, and
invite him to return to England, passed without opposition. Now the
Emperor had no longer any scruple in letting him go. He said as to this
very matter, that what is undertaken at the wrong time hinders the
result which might else have been expected; everything has its time: the
time for this appeared to him now come. From Philip we have a letter to
his sister Juana in which he extols himself with much satisfaction for
the share he had taken in recalling the cardinal and restoring the Papal
authority. 'I and the most illustrious Queen,' he says in it, 'commanded
the Parliament of the three Estates of the realm to recall him; we
especially used our efforts with the chief among them to induce them to
consent to the cardinal's return: at our order prelates and knights
escorted him to our Court, where he has delivered to us the Breve of his
Holiness.'&mdash;'We then through the Chancellor of the realm informed the
Estates of what seemed to us becoming, above all how much it concerned
themselves to come to a conclusion that would give peace to their
conscience.'<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<p>The Parliament declared itself ready to return to the obedience of the
Roman See, and repeal all the statutes against it, provided that the
cardinal pronounced a general dispensation, that every man might keep
without scruple the ecclesiastical property which had fallen to his
share.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>
On this understanding Cardinal Pole was allowed to exercise
his legatine power, and the King and Queen were entreated to intercede
that the absolution might be bestowed.</p>

<p>With heartfelt joy Cardinal Pole pronounced it without delay, first at a
meeting of the Parliament in the palace, then with greater solemnity at
S. Paul's at a high mass attended by the Court with a brilliant suite;
among those present were the knights who wore the Burgundian order of
the Golden Fleece, and those who wore the English Order of the Garter.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
The King stood by the Chancellor when from the outer corridor of the
church he announced the event and its motives to the great crowds there
assembled. It made an impression on the imperial ambassadors that no
outward sign of discontent was heard.</p>

<p>The agreement that now followed bears more of a juridical than of a
religious character. The jurisdiction was given back to the Pope which
he possessed before the twentieth year of Henry VIII (1529): the
statutes by which it was abolished were severally enumerated and
repealed: on the other hand the Pope's legate in his name consented that
the owners of church property should not be disturbed in their
possession, either now or at any future time, either by church councils
or by Papal decrees. Such property was henceforth to be quite as
exclusively subject to the jurisdiction of the crown as any other;
whoever dared to call in question the validity of the title in any
spiritual court whatever, within or without the realm, was to be
punished as an enemy of the Queen. The cardinal legate strove long to
prevent the two enactments, as to the restoration of obedience and the
title to the ecclesiastical property, from being combined together in
one Act, since it might look as if the Pope's concession was the price
of this obedience to him; he once said, he would rather let all remain
as it was and go back to Rome than yield on this point. But the English
nobility adhered immoveably to its demand; it wished to prevent all
danger of the restoration of obedience becoming in any way detrimental
to its acquisitions, an object which was clearly best secured by
combining both enactments in a single statute, so that they must stand
or fall together; even the King's representations effected no alteration
in this; the cardinal had to comply.</p>

<p>On the other hand the King's influence, if we believe himself, had all
possible success in the other affair, which was at any rate not less
weighty. 'With the intervention of the Parliament,' he continues in the
above-mentioned letter, 'we have made a law, I and the most illustrious
Queen, for the punishment of heretics and all enemies of holy church; we
have revived the old ordinances of the realm, which will serve this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
purpose very well.' It was more especially the statute against the
Lollards, by which Henry V had entered into the closest alliance with
the hierarchy, that was to be re-enacted by Parliament. Gardiner had not
been able to carry it through in the previous session, though it was
known that the Queen wished it. Under the King's influence, who was
accustomed to the execution of heretics in Spain, the Lords after some
deliberation let their objections drop and accepted the bill.</p>

<p>If we put together these four great Acts, the abolition of the Common
Prayer-book, the Spanish marriage, the restoration of obedience to Rome,
and the revival of the heresy laws, we could hardly doubt the intention
of the members of the government, and of the Parliament, to return
completely to the ancient political and religious state of things. With
some members such an intention may have been the predominant one: to
assume it in all, or even in the majority, would be an
error.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<p>The agreement then legalised as to ecclesiastical property, and the
abolition of the monastic system, already formed such an anomaly in the
Roman Catholic church, that the ecclesiastical condition of England
would have always retained a very abnormal character. And the obedience
expressed was by no means complete. For it should have included above
all a recognition of that right of dispensation, about which the
original quarrel had broken out, and the revocation of the order of
succession which was based on its rejection. In fact Gardiner's
intention was to bring matters to this; being besides a great enemy and
even persecutor of Elizabeth, he wished to see her illegitimacy
pronounced in due form;<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>
the resolutions passed seemed necessarily
to lead to it. Men however did not proceed this time so logically in
England. They did not wish to base the future state of the realm on
Papal decrees, but on the ordinances once
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
enacted by King and Parliament. They could not deceive themselves as to the fact that
Elizabeth, though she conformed outwardly, yet remained true at heart to
the Protestant faith; but not on that account would the Parliament deny
her right to the English throne. It also by no means entertained exactly
Spanish sentiments. The Emperor expressed the wish that his son might be
crowned: his ambassador's advice however was against proposing it in
Parliament; since, with the high ideas entertained in England of the
rights implied in the coronation, this would never be allowed. In the
event of the Queen's dying before Philip, and leaving children, the
guardianship was reserved to him: but even for this object conditions
had been originally proposed which would have been much more
advantageous to him: these the Upper House threw out. So little was even
then the policy of the Queen and King at the same time the policy of the
nation and Parliament. In the Privy Council the old discords continued.
The government obtained a greater unity by the fact that Gardiner, who
now followed the Queen's lead in every respect, carried most of the
members with him by the authority which her favour gave him. As Paget
and Arundel, since they could effect nothing, refused to appear any
more, there always remained a secret support for the discontent that was
stirring. In the beginning of 1555 traces of a conspiracy in favour of
Courtenay were again detected: if the inquiry into it led to no
discovery, it was because&mdash;so it was thought&mdash;the commission entrusted
with it did not wish to make any.</p>

<p>At this moment the revived heresy-laws began to be put into execution.
Prosecutions were instituted for statements that under another order of
things would have been considered as fully authorised. Still more than
to single offences was attention directed to any variations in doctrine.
In these proceedings we can remark the points which were then chiefly in
question.</p>

<p>The first of the accused, one of the earliest and most influential of
the martyrs, John Rogers, was reminded of the article which speaks of
the faith in one holy catholic church; he replied that by it was meant
the universal church of all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
lands and times, not the Romish, which on
the contrary had deviated in many points from the main foundation of all
churches, Holy Scripture. Rowland Taylor, who gloried in a marriage
blest with children, which Gardiner would not acknowledge to be a
marriage at all, maintained that Christian antiquity had allowed the
marriage of priests. Gardiner accused him of ignorance. 'But,' said
Taylor, 'I have read the Holy Scripture, the Latin and the Greek
fathers;' a canon of the Nicene council, which was cited on the point,
he interpreted far more correctly than the bishop. John Hooper was
called in question because he held divorce to be permissible on the
ground given in Scripture, and because he found that the view of the
real presence had no foundation in
Scripture.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>
Their offence was the
conception of church-communion as resting on the foundation of Scripture
and extending therefore far beyond Romanism: the most telling defence
could not save them here, for only the carrying out of old laws was
concerned, and these unconditionally condemned such opinions. As the
condemned were being taken back by night to their prison, many
householders came out of their doors with lights in their hands, to
greet them with their prayers and thank them for their steadfastness: a
deep and sorrowful sympathy, but one which scarcely dared to utter
itself, and thus renounced the attempt to effect anything. Rogers
suffered death in London, Hooper at his episcopal see of Gloucester,
Taylor (who on the way showed as much good wit as Sir Thomas More had
formerly done) in his parish, Saunders at Coventry, Ferrar in the
market-place at Caermarthen. Their punishment, in every place where they
had taught, was intended to confirm the doctrines they had rejected.
There have been more bloody persecutions elsewhere: this was
distinguished by the fact that many of the more eminent men of the
nation became its victims. Among them, besides those we have named, were
Ridley, who was looked on as the most learned scholar in England, the
eloquent Latimer, Bradford a man of deep piety, Philpot who united
learning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
and religion. How could Archbishop Cranmer, who had
contributed almost more than any one to carry through the Reformation,
who had pronounced the divorce of the Queen's mother, possibly find
mercy? He persuaded himself of it once; and, yielding as he was, allowed
himself to be tempted into a recantation, in despite of which he was
condemned to death. But then there awoke in him also the whole
consciousness of the truth of his belief. The hand with which he had
signed the recantation he held firm, and let it burn in unutterable
agony, as an expiation which he imposed on himself, before the flame of
the faggots closed over him. The executions extended themselves over the
whole country and even over the neighbouring islands; the diaries show
that they continued till 1558. Many could have fled, but wished to
testify to the firmness of their belief by dying for it, and thus to
strengthen in their faith the people from whom they were taken away.
Most of them showed a sublime contempt of death, which inflamed others
to imitate them. How many would have been prepared to throw themselves
with their friends into the flames! And no one could say that here there
was any question of tendencies to revolt. The Protestants had on the
whole kept themselves far from it: they did not contest the Queen's
right to the throne; they died as her obedient subjects.</p>

<p>But now what an impression must these executions produce, combined with
what preceded and followed them.</p>

<p>Gardiner appears in all this imperious, proud, and with that confident
tone which the possessors of power assume, implying that they regard
themselves as being also mentally superior; Bonner Bishop of London
fanatical, without any power of discernment, and almost bloodthirsty.
His attention was once drawn to the ill effects of his rough acts of
violence; he replied that he must do God's work without fear of men.
Under the last government they had both had much to endure: they had
been deprived by their enemies and thrown into prison: now they employed
the temporal arm in their own favour; they felt no scruple in sentencing
their old opponents to death in accordance with the severity of the laws
which they had again brought into active operation. Such was the issue
of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
the contest between the bishops under the changing systems of
government.</p>

<p>As Queen Mary is designated 'The Bloody,' we are astonished when we read
the authentic descriptions, still extant, of her personal appearance.
She was a little, slim, delicate, sickly woman, with hair already
turning grey. She played on the lute, and had even given instruction in
music; she had a skilful hand; on personal acquaintance she made the
impression of goodness and mildness. But yet there was something in her
eyes that could even rouse fear; her voice, which could be heard at a
great distance, told of something unwomanly in her. She was a good
speaker in public; never did she show a trace of timidity in danger. The
troubles she had experienced from her youth, her constant antagonism to
the authority under which she lived, had especially hardened in her the
self-will which is recognisable in all the Tudors. A peculiarity found
elsewhere also in gifted women, that they are weary of all which
surrounds them at home, and give to what is foreign a sympathy above its
worth, had become to her a second nature. She rejected with aversion the
idea of marrying Courtenay, for this reason among others that he was an
Englishman. She, the Queen of England, had no sympathy for the life, the
interests, the struggles of her people: she hated them from her
childhood. All her sympathies were for the nation from which her mother
came, for its views and manners: her husband was her ideal of a man: we
are assured that she even overlooked his infidelities to her because he
did not enter into permanent relations with any other woman. Besides
this he was the only man who could support her in the great project for
which she thought herself marked out by God, the restoration of
Catholicism.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>
This is the meaning of her pledging herself in her
bedchamber before a crucifix, when she had not yet seen him, to give her
hand to him and to no other. For with him and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
his fortunes were linked the hopes of a restoration of Catholicism. Mary was absolutely
determined to do all she could to strengthen it in England. Gardiner
assures us, and we may believe him in this, that it was not he who
prompted the revival of the old laws against the Lollards; the chief
impulse to it came on the contrary from the Queen. And as those laws
ordered the punishment of heretics by fire, and Parliament had
consented, and the orthodox bishops offered their aid, it would have
seemed to her a blameable weakness, if out of feelings of compassion she
had stood in the way of the execution of those laws, to the suspension
of which the bishops ascribed the spread of heretical opinions. Many of
the horrors which accompanied their execution may have remained
concealed from her; still it cannot be doubted, that the persecutions
would never have begun without her. No excuse can free her memory from
the dark shade which rests on it. For that which is done in a
sovereign's name, with his will and consent, determines his character in
history.</p>

<p>The conduct of the Queen and her government, without whose help
ecclesiastical authority would have been null and void, had a result
that extended far beyond her time: men began to inquire into the claims
of the temporal power. John Knox, who had now to fly from England before
a Queen, as he had previously from Scotland before a Queen-regent, and
whose word was of weight, poured forth his feelings in a piercing call,
which he himself named 'a blast of the trumpet,' against the right of
women to the government of a country, which ought to be exercised only
by men. And while Knox went no further than the immediate case, others
examined into the powers of all State authority: above all, to prevent
its taking part in religious persecution, they brought forward the
principles according to which sovereignty issues originally from the
people. Mary's government had awakened in Protestantism, and that not
merely in England, the hostility of political theory.</p>

<p>But besides no man could hide from himself, that discontent, even
without theory, had grown in England in an alarming manner. The French
and Imperial ambassadors
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
both gave their courts information of it, the
former with a kind of satisfaction, the latter with apprehension and
pain. He laments the bad effect which the religious persecution
produces, makes pressing objections to it and demands that the bloody
zeal of the bishops shall be moderated; but the matter was regularly
proceeding in a kind of legal way; we do not find that he effected
anything.</p>

<p>The Queen had hitherto flattered herself and her partisans with the hope
that she would give the country an heir to the throne. When this
expectation proved fallacious in the summer of 1555 it produced an
impression which, as the imperial ambassador says, no pen could
describe. The appearance had been caused by an unhealthy condition of
body, which was now looked on rather as a prognostic of her fast
approaching death. It is already clear, remarks the ambassador, that
least confidence can be placed in those who have been hitherto most
trusted: many a man still wears a mask: others even show their ill-will
quite openly. For so badly is the succession at present arranged that my
lady Elizabeth will without doubt ascend the throne on Mary's death and
will restore heresy.</p>

<p>While things were in this state, Philip II was led to resolve on going
to the Netherlands by the vicissitudes of the French war and his
father's state of health; he wished either to bring about peace, or to
push the war with energy.</p>

<p>He had hitherto exercised a moderating influence on the government. Not
to let all fall back into the previous party-strife, he thought it best
to give the eight leading members of the Privy Council a pre-eminent
place in the management of business. He could not avoid admitting men of
both parties even among these; but he had already found a man whom he
could set over the others and trust with the supreme rule of affairs in
complete confidence. This was Cardinal Pole, who after Cranmer's death
received the Archbishopric of Canterbury, long ago bestowed on him at
Rome, and was released from the duty of again returning to the Roman
court. He was descended from the house of the Yorkist Suffolks,
persecuted by the earlier Tudors with great severity; but how
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
completely did this family difference recede before the world-wide
interests of religion! He served with the most entire devotion a queen
of the house of Lancaster-Tudor who on her side reposed in him unlimited
reliance: she wished to have him about her for hours every day. Reginald
Pole was a man of European and general ecclesiastical culture; he shared
in a tendency existing within Catholicism itself, which approached very
nearly to Protestantism on one dogmatic question: we also hear that he
would gladly have moderated the
persecution;<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>
but when it is said,
that the obstinacy of the Protestants hindered him in this, all that can
be implied is, that they held fast to a confession which was now
absolutely condemned by the hierarchic laws, while he was bound and
resolved to carry these laws into effect. His chief care was above all
not to be involved in English party-divisions: he therefore usually
worked with a couple of Italian assistants who shared his sentiments and
his plans. The union of the ecclesiastical and temporal authority is
seen once more in Pole, as it had been in Wolsey: he combined the powers
of a legate with the position of a first minister. His distinguished
birth, his high ecclesiastical rank, the confidence of the King and
Queen, enhanced by completely blameless personal
conduct,<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>
procured him an authority in the country which seemed almost that of the
sovereign.</p>

<p>A singular government this, composed of an absent king, who however had
to be consulted in all weighty matters, a cardinal, and a dying queen
who lived exclusively in church ideas. Difficulties could not be
wanting: they arose first in church matters themselves.</p>

<p>We know how much the recognition of the alienation of the church
property, to which Julius III was brought to consent by the Emperor,
contributed to the restoration of church obedience; among the English
nobility it formed the main
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
ground of its submission. But in May 1555
Pope Paul IV ascended the Papal throne, in whom dislike of the
Austro-Spanish house was almost a passion, and who wished to base his
ecclesiastical reputation on the recovery of the alienated church
property. His third Bull orders its restoration, including the
possessions of monastic foundations, and the revenues hitherto received
from them. The English ambassadors who had been sent to Rome under
wholly different conditions, to announce the restoration of obedience,
found this Pope there on their arrival. When they mentioned the
confirmation of the alienation of the monastic property, he answered
them in plain terms: for himself he would be ready to consent, but it
lay beyond his power; the property of the church was sacred and
inviolable, all that belonged to it must be restored to the uttermost
farthing. And so ecclesiastically minded was Queen Mary that she in her
heart agreed with the Pope. The monasteries in particular she held to be
an indispensable part of the church-system, and wished for their
restoration. Already the fugitive monks were seen returning: a number of
Benedictines who had remained in the country resumed the dress of their
Order; the Queen made no secret of her wish to restore the monastery of
Westminster in particular. Another side of church life was affected by
the fact that, owing to the suppression of the great abbeys, a number of
benefices, which were dependent on them, had lost their incomes and had
fallen into decay. That Henry VIII should have appropriated to the crown
the tenths and first-fruits, which belonged to the church, seemed to
Queen Mary unjustifiable; she felt herself straitened in her conscience
by retaining these revenues, and was prepared to give them back,
whatever might be the loss to the crown. But she could not by herself
repeal what had been done under authority of Parliament: in November
1555 she attempted to gain over that assembly to her view. A number of
influential members were summoned to the palace, where first Cardinal
Pole explained to them that the receipt of the first-fruits was
connected with the State's claim of supremacy over the church, but that,
after obedience was restored, it had no longer any real justification.
He put forward some further reasons, and then the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
Queen herself took up
the word. She laid the greatest stress on her personal wish. She asked
the Parliament, after having shown obedience to her in so many ways, to
prove to her that the peace of her soul lay near their hearts, and to
take this burden from her. But the conception of the crown and its
property had in England already ceased to be so merely personal. The
most universally intelligible motive in the whole church-movement was
the feeling, that the resources of the nation ought to be devoted to
national purposes, and every one felt that the diminution of the royal
revenues would have to be made up by Parliamentary grants. In addition
to this, it appeared to be only the first step to such an universal
restitution, as Pope Paul IV clearly contemplated and directed. Was
there not much more to be said for the recovery of the church revenues
from private hands than for their withdrawal from the crown which used
them for public purposes?&mdash;A member of the Lower House wished to answer
the Queen at once after her address: but, as he was not the Speaker, he
was not allowed to do so.</p>

<p>When the proposal came under discussion in the Lower House, it met with
lively opposition. A commission was then appointed, to which the Upper
House sent two earls, two barons, and two bishops, and to which some
lawyers were added; by these the proposed articles were revised and then
laid before them again. The decisive sitting was on the 3rd December
1555. The doors were closed: no stranger was allowed to enter nor any
member to leave the House. After they had sat in hot debate from early
morning till three in the afternoon&mdash;just one of those debates, of which
we have to regret that no detailed account has survived&mdash;the proposal
was, it is true, accepted, but against such a large minority as was
hitherto unheard of in the English Parliament, 120 votes to 183. Queen
and cardinal regarded it as a great victory, for they had carried their
view: but the tone of the country was still against them. However strong
the stress which the cardinal laid on the statement that the concession
of the crown was not to react in any way on private men's ownership of
church property, the apprehension was nevertheless
universal,<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>
that with the Queen's zeal for the monasteries,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
and a consistent carrying
out of the Pope's principles, things would yet come to this. But the
interests which would be thus injured were very widespread. It was
calculated that there were 40,000 families which in one way or another
owned part of the church property: they would neither relinquish it nor
allow their title to be called in question. Powerful lords were heard to
exclaim that they would keep the abbey-lands as long as they had a sword
by their side. The popular disposition was reflected in the widespread
rumour, which gained credence, that Edward VI was still alive and would
soon come back.</p>

<p>From time to time seditious movements showed the insecurity of the
situation. At the beginning of 1556 traces were detected of a plan for
plundering the treasury in order to levy troops with the
money.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a>
The Western counties were discontented because Courtenay was removed from
among them: he died subsequently in Italy. Sir Henry Dudley, the Duke of
Northumberland's cousin, rallied around him some zealous and
enterprising malcontents, who planned a complete revolution: he found
secret support in France, whither he
fled.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>
In April 1557 a grandson of the Duke of Buckingham, Thomas Stafford, also coming from France,
landed and made himself master of Scarborough castle. He had only a
handful of followers, but he ventured to proclaim himself Protector of
the realm, which he promised to secure against the tyranny of
foreigners, and 'the satanic designs of an unlawful Queen.' He was
crushed without difficulty. But in the general ferment which this
aroused, it was observed how universal was the wish for a
change.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p><p>Meanwhile foreign affairs took a turn which threatened to involve
England in a dangerous complication. The peace between the great powers
had not been concluded: the truce they had made was broken off at the
instigation of the Pope; hostilities began again, and Philip II returned
to England for a couple of months to induce her to join in the war
against France. The diplomatic correspondence shows that the imperial
court from the beginning valued their near relation to England chiefly
as the basis of an alliance against France. We can easily understand how
this early object was now attained. Besides many other previous wrongs,
Stafford's enterprise, which was ascribed to the intrigues of France,
was a motive for declaring war against that Power. And a French war
still retained its old charm for the English: their share in it
surpassed all expectation. The English land forces co-operated with
decisive effect in the great victory of S. Quintin, and similarly the
appearance of the English fleet on the French coasts ensured Philip's
predominance on the ocean. But it is very doubtful whether this was the
part the English power should have played at this moment. By his
father's abdication and retirement into the cloister Philip had become
lord and master of the Spanish monarchy. Could it be the mission of the
English to help in consolidating it in his hands? On the foundation then
laid, and mainly through the peace which France saw herself compelled to
make, its greatness was built up. For the Spanish monarchy the union
with England, which rested on the able use to which the existing
troubles and the personal position of the Queen were turned&mdash;and which,
strictly speaking, was still a result of the policy of Ferdinand the
Catholic&mdash;was of indescribable advantage: to the English it brought a
loss which was severely felt. They had neglected to put Calais in a
proper state of defence; at the first attack it fell into the hands of
the French. The greatest value was still laid in England on a possession
across the sea, which seemed indispensable for the command of the
Channel; its extension was the main object of Henry VIII's last war:
that now it was on the contrary utterly lost was felt to be a national
disaster; the population of the town, which consisted of English, was
expelled together with the garrison.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
And as Pope Paul IV was now allied with the King of France, the result
was that he found himself at war with Philip II (whom he tried to chase
from Naples), and hence with England as well. His hatred to the house of
Austria, his aversion to the concessions made in England with reference
to church property, and to the religious position which Cardinal Pole
had hitherto taken up in the questions at issue within the Catholic
Church, determined the Pope to interfere in the home affairs of England
with a strong hand. For these Cardinal Pole was the one indispensable
man, on whose shoulders the burden of affairs rested. But it was this
very man whom Paul IV now deprived of his legatine power, on which much
of his consequence rested, and transferred it to a Franciscan monk.</p>

<p>But what now was the consequent situation of affairs in England! The
Queen, who recognised no higher authority than that of the Papal See,
was obliged to have Paul IV's messages intercepted, lest they should
become known. While the ashes of the reputed heretics were still smoking
on their Calvaries, the man who represented the Catholic form of
religion, and was working effectively for its progress, was accused of
falling away from the orthodox faith, and summoned to Rome to answer for
it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile England did not feel herself strong enough, even with the help
that Philip offered, to attempt the reconquest of Calais. The finances
were completely disordered by the war; and the Parliament showed little
zeal in restoring the balance: just before this the Queen had found
herself obliged even to diminish the amount of a subsidy already as good
as voted. However unwilling she might be to take the step after her
previous experiences, she had to decide once more in the autumn of 1558
on calling a Parliament. Circumstances wore an appearance all the more
dangerous, as the Scotch were allied with the victorious French: the
Queen represented to the Commons the need of extraordinary means of
defence. A number of the leading lords appeared in the Lower House to
give additional weight to the demand of the Crown by their presence. The
Commons, though not quite willingly, were proceeding to deliberate on
the subsidies demanded, when an event happened which relieved them from
the necessity of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
coming to any resolution.</p>

<p>A tertian or quartan fever was then prevalent in the Netherlands and in
England, which was very fatal, especially to elderly persons of
enfeebled health.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>
The Queen, who had been for some time visited by
her usual attacks of illness, could not resist this disease, when
suffering besides, as she was, from deep affliction at the
disappointment of all her hopes, and from heart-rending anticipations of
the future: once more she heard mass in her chamber&mdash;she died before it
was ended, on the 17 November 1558. Cardinal Pole also was suffering:
completely crushed by this news he expired the following night. It was
calculated that thirteen bishops died a little before or after the
Queen. As if by some predetermined fate the combination of English
affairs which had been attempted during her government came at once to
an end.</p>

<p class='center'><br />QUEEN ELIZABETH. CLOSE CONNEXION OF ENGLISH AND SCOTCH AFFAIRS.</p>

<p>To appreciate the motives which led Henry VIII to attach such importance
to a male heir, and to exclude his daughter by the Spanish marriage from
the succession, we need only cast our eyes on what happened under her,
when in spite of all she had become Queen. The idea with which the
Tudors had ascended the throne, and administered the realm, that of
founding a political power strong in itself and alike independent of
home factions and foreign influence, was sacrificed by Mary to her
preference for the nation from which her mother came and from which she
chose her husband. The military power of England served to support the
Spanish monarchy at a dangerous and doubtful moment in the course of its
formation. And while Mary's father and brother had made it the object of
their policy to deprive the hierarchy of all influence over England, she
on the contrary reinstated it: she put the power and all the resources
of the State at its disposal. Though historically deeply rooted, the
Catholic tendency showed itself, through the reactionary rule which it
brought about and through its alliance with the policy of Spain,
pernicious to the country. We have seen what losses England suffered by
it, not merely in its foreign possessions, but&mdash;what was really
irreparable&mdash;in men of talent and learning, of feeling and greatness of
soul; and into what a state of weakness abroad and dissolution at home
it thereby fell. A new order of things must arise, if the national
element, the creation of which had been the labour of centuries, was not
to be crushed, and the mighty efforts of later ages were not to succumb
to religious and political reaction. </p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class='centersm'><a name="BIII_I" id="BIII_I"></a>
ELIZABETH'S ACCESSION. TRIUMPH OF THE REFORMATION.</p>

<p>During Mary's government, which had been endurable only because men
foresaw its speedy end, all eyes were directed to her younger sister
Elizabeth. She was the daughter of Anne Boleyn, who bore her under her
heart when she was crowned as Queen. After many changes, Henry VIII, in
agreement with Parliament, had recognised her right of inheritance; the
people had risen against the enterprise of the Duke of Northumberland
for her as well as for Mary. And it had also been maintained against
Mary herself. Once, in Wyatt's conspiracy, letters were found, which
pointed at Elizabeth's having a share in it: she was designated in them
as the future Queen. The predominant Spanish-Catholic party had her
examined and would have much wished to find her guilty, in order to rid
themselves of her for ever. But Elizabeth was not so imprudent as to
lend her hand to a movement, which if unsuccessful&mdash;a result not hard to
foresee&mdash;must destroy her own good title. And moreover she, with her
innate pride, could not possibly have carried out the wishes of the
French by marrying Courtenay, whom her sister had rejected. The letter,
which she wrote to Mary at this crisis, is full of unfeignedly loyal
submission to her Queen, before whom she only wishes to bend her knee,
to pray her not to let herself be prejudiced by false charges against
her sister; and yet at the same time it is highminded and great in the
consciousness of innocence. Mary, who was now no longer her friend, did
not vouchsafe her a hearing, but sent her to the Tower and subjected her
to a criminal examination. But however zealously they sought for proofs
against her, yet they found none: and they dared not touch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>her life
unless she were first publicly found guilty. She was clearly the heiress
to the throne appointed under the authorisation of Parliament: the
people would not give up the prospects of the future which were linked
with her. When she appeared in London at this moment of peril,
surrounded by numerous attendants, in an open litter, with an expression
in which hopeful buoyant youth mingled with the feeling of innocence and
distress, pale and proud, she swayed the masses that crowded round her
with no doubtful sympathy.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>
When she passed through the streets
after her liberation, she was received with an enthusiasm which made the
Queen jealous on her throne.</p>

<p>Yet Elizabeth was not merely the head of the popular opposition to her
sister's policy: from the first moment onwards she was in collision with
another female foe, whose pretensions would determine the relations of
her life. If Henry VIII formerly in settling the succession passed over
in silence the rights of his married sister in Scotland, which had now
come to her granddaughter Mary Stuart, the memory of them was now all
the more vividly revived by the Catholic party in the country. For with
the religious reverence which men devoted to the Papacy it was not at
all possible to reconcile the recognition of Elizabeth, whose very
existence was as it were at variance with it. Nor was a political motive
for preferring Mary Stuart wanting. That for which Henry VIII and
Somerset had striven so zealously, the union of England and Scotland,
would be thus attained at once. They were not afraid that Scotland might
thus become predominant; Henry VII at the conclusion of the marriage,
having his attention drawn to this possible risk, replied with the
maxim, that the larger and more powerful part always draws the smaller
after it. The indispensable condition for the development of the English
power lay in the union of the whole island: this would have ensued in a
Catholic, not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
in a Protestant, sense. Was not this union of political
advantage and religious concord likely to influence the Privy Council of
England, which under Mary was again zealously Catholic, and also to
influence Queen Mary Tudor herself?</p>

<p>Great political questions however do not usually present themselves to
men in such perfect clearness, but are seen under the modifying
circumstances of the moment. It was at that time all important that Mary
Stuart had married the Dauphin: she would have united England not merely
with Scotland, but at the same time with France, thus bringing it for
ever under the influence of that country. How revolting must such a
prospect have been to all English feeling! England would have become a
transmarine province of France, it would in time have been absorbed like
Brittany. Above all, French policy would have completely gained the
upper hand in Europe. This apprehension induced the Spanish
statesmen&mdash;Elizabeth's eager enemies as long as they expected their King
to have issue of Mary Tudor&mdash;when this hope failed, to give the princess
sympathy and attention. Philip II, when her troubles revived (for both
Gardiner and Pole were her enemies), informed her through secret
messengers, that he was her good friend and would not abandon her. Now
that Mary was failing before all men's eyes, and every one was looking
forward to her death, it was his evident interest to further Elizabeth's
accession. In this sense spoke his ambassador Feria, whom he sent at
this moment to England, before the assembled Privy
Council;<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>
even Mary was urged to declare herself to the same effect. From an advice
written for Elizabeth during the first moments of her reign we see that
all still looked very dangerous: she was urged in it to possess herself
of the Tower and there to receive the allegiance of the high officers of
State, to allow no departure from the English ports, and so on. Men
expected turbulent movements at home, and were not without apprehension
of an attempt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
at invasion from France. The decision however followed
without any commotion and on the spot. Though most of its members were
Catholic, the Privy Council did not hesitate. A few hours after Mary's
decease the Commons were summoned to the Upper House, to receive a
communication there: it was, that Mary was dead, and that God had given
them another Queen, My lady Elizabeth. The Parliament dissolved; the new
Queen was proclaimed in Westminster and in London. Some days afterwards
she made her entry into the capital amidst the indescribable rejoicings
of the people, who greeted her accession as their deliverance and their
salvation.</p>

<p>But if this, as we see, involved in its very essence a hostile attitude
towards France and Scotland, on the other hand the question was at once
laid before the Queen, and in the most personal way imaginable, how far
she would unite herself with Spain, the great Power which was now on her
side. Philip resolved, inasmuch as propriety in some measure allowed it,
to ask for her hand&mdash;not indeed from personal inclination, of which
there is no trace, but from policy and perhaps from religion: he hoped
by this means to keep England firm to the Spanish alliance and to
Catholicism.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a>
And on the English side also much might be said for
it. An ally was needed against France, even to obtain a tolerable peace:
there was some danger that Philip, if rejected by the Queen, might
perhaps marry a French princess; to be secure against the French claims
the Queen seemed to need the support of Spain. Her first answer was not
in the negative. She declared she must consult with Parliament as to the
King's proposal: but he might be assured that, if she ever married, she
would not give any one else the preference over him.</p>

<p>Well considered, these words announce at once her resolution not to
marry. Between Mary Tudor who thought to bring the crown to the heir of
Spain, and Mary Stuart similarly pledged to the heir of France, nothing
was left for her&mdash;since she would not wish the husband of her choice to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
be of inferior rank&mdash;but to remain unmarried. From listening to Philip's
wooing she was kept back by her sister's example, whose marriage had
destroyed her popularity. And for Elizabeth there would have been yet
another danger in this alliance. Was not her legitimacy dependent on the
invalidity of her father's marriage with his brother's widow? It would
be a very similar case if she were to marry her sister's husband.
Besides she would have needed the Pope's dispensation for such a
union&mdash;as Philip had already explained to her&mdash;while her birth and crown
were the results of a Papal dispensation being declared a nullity. She
would thus have fallen into a self-contradiction, to which she must have
succumbed in course of time. When told that Philip II had done her some
service, she acknowledged it: but when she meditated on it further, she
found that neither this sovereign nor any other influence whatever would
have protected her from her enemies, had not the people shown her an
unlimited devotion.<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>
This devotion, on which her whole existence
depended, she would not forfeit. After a little delay she let Philip
know that she felt some scruples as to the Papal dispensation. She gave
weight to the point which had been under discussion, but added that she
was altogether disinclined to marry. We may doubt whether this was her
immoveably formed resolution, considering how often afterwards she
negociated about her marriage. It might seem to her allowable, as an
instrument of policy, to excite hopes which she did not mean to fulfil:
or her views may in fact have again wavered: but these oscillations in
her statements can mean nothing when set over against a great necessity:
her actual conduct shows that she had a vivid insight into it and held
firm to it with tenacious resolution. She was Henry's daughter, but she
knew how to keep herself as independent as he had thought that only a
son could possibly do. There is a deep truth in her phrase, that she is
wedded to her people: regard to their interests kept her back from any
other union.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
But if she resolved to give up the relation of close union in which
England had hitherto stood with Spain, it was indispensable to make
peace with France. It was impossible to attain this if she insisted on
the restoration of Calais; she resolved to give it up, at first for a
term of years. Of almost the same date as her answer of refusal to
Philip's ambassador is her instruction empowering her ambassador to let
Calais go, as soon as he saw that the Spaniards would conclude their
peace with France without stipulating for its restoration. She was able
to venture this, for however deeply the nation felt the loss of the
place, the blame for it could not be imputed to her. Without repeating
what was then asserted, that her distinct aim was to turn the hatred of
the nation against the late government and its alliance with Spain, we
may still allow that this must have been the actual result, as it really
proved to be. It was indeed said that Philip II, who not merely
concluded peace with France but actually married a daughter of Henry II,
would make common cause with him against England: but Elizabeth no more
allowed herself to be misled by this possibility, which also had much
against it, than Henry VIII had been under similar circumstances. Like
him and like the founder of her family, she took up an independent
position between the two powers, equally ready according to
circumstances for war or peace with one or the other.</p>

<p>Meanwhile she had already proceeded to measures which could never have
been reconciled with the Spanish alliance, and to ecclesiastical changes
which first gave her position its true character.</p>

<p>Her earliest intimation of again deviating from the Church was given by
restoring, like a devoted daughter, her father's monument, which Mary
had levelled with the ground. A second soon followed, which at once
touched on the chief doctrine in dispute. Before attending a solemn high
mass she required the officiating bishop to omit the elevation of the
host. As he refused, she left the church at the moment the ceremony was
being consummated. To check the religious strife which began to fill the
pulpits she forbade preaching, like her predecessors; but she allowed
the Sunday Lessons, the Litany, and the Creed to be read in English.
Elizabeth had hitherto conformed to the restored Catholic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span> ritual: it
could not be quite said that she belonged to either of the existing
confessions. She always declared that she had read no controversial
writings. But she had occupied herself with the documents of the early
Church, with the Greek and Latin Fathers, and was thoroughly convinced
that the Romanism of the later centuries had gone far astray from this
pattern. She had made up her mind, not as to every point of doctrine,
but as to its general direction: she believed too that she was upheld
and guarded by God, to carry out this change. 'How wonderful are God's
ordinances,' she exclaimed, when she heard that the crown had fallen to
her.</p>

<p>What course however was now to be taken was a question which, owing to
the antagonism of the factions and the close connexion of all
ecclesiastical and political matters, required the most mature
consideration.</p>

<p>The Queen was advised simply to revert to Edward VI's regulations, and
to declare all things null and void that had been enacted under Mary,
mainly on the ground that they had been enacted in violation of legal
forms. A speech was laid before her, in which the validity of the last
elections was disputed, since qualified members had been excluded from
the sittings of both houses, although they were good Englishmen: the
later proclamations of summons were held to be null, because in them the
formula 'Supreme Head of the English Church' had been arbitrarily
omitted, without a previous resolution of Parliament, though on this
title so much depended for the commonwealth and people: but no one could
give up a right which concerned a third person or the public interest;
through these errors, which Mary had committed in her blindness, all
that had then been determined lost its force and
authority.<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>
But the Queen and her counsellors did not wish to go so far. They remarked that
to declare a Parliament invalid for some errors of form was a step of
such consequence as to make the whole government of the nation insecure.
But even without this it was not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
the Queen's purpose merely to revert
to the forms which had been adopted under her brother. She did not share
all the opinions and doctrines which had then obtained the upper hand:
she held far more to ceremonies and outward forms than Edward VI or his
counsellors: she wished to avoid a rude antagonism which would have
called forth the resistance of the Catholics.</p>

<p>In the Parliament that met immediately after the coronation (which was
still celebrated by a Catholic bishop), they began with the question
which had most occupied the late assembly, namely, should the Church
revenues that had been attached to the crown be restored to it. The
Queen's proposal, that they should be left to the crown, was quite the
view of the assembly and obtained their full consent.</p>

<p>The Parliamentary form of government however had also the greatest
influence on religious affairs. Having risen originally in opposition to
Rome, the Parliament, after the vicissitudes of the civil wars, first
recovered its full importance when it took the side of the crown in its
struggle with the Papacy. It did not so much concern itself with Dogma
for its own sake: it had thought it possible to unite the retention of
Catholicism with national independence. Under Mary every man had become
conscious that this would be impossible. It was just then that the
Parliament passed from its previous compliant mood into opposition,
which was not yet successful because it was only that of the minority,
but which prepared the way for the coming change of tone. It attached
itself joyfully to the new Queen, whose birth necessarily made her adopt
a policy which took away all apprehensions of a union with the Romish
See injurious to the country.</p>

<p>The complete antagonism between the Papal and the Parliamentary powers,
of which one had swayed past centuries and the other was to sway the
future, is shown by the conduct of the Pope, when Elizabeth announced
her accession to him. In his answer he reproached her with it as
presumption, reverted to the decision of his predecessors by which she
was declared illegitimate, required that the whole matter should be
referred to him, and even mentioned England's feudal relation to the
Papacy:<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>
but Parliament, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
had rejected this claim centuries
before, acknowledged Elizabeth as legitimately sprung from the royal
blood, and as Queen by the law of God and of the land; they pledged
themselves to defend her title and right with their lives and property.</p>

<p>Owing to this the tendencies towards separation from Rome were already
sure to gain the superiority: the Catholic members of the Privy Council,
to whom Elizabeth owed her first recognition, could not contend
effectively against them. But besides this, Elizabeth had joined with
them a number of men of her own choice and her own views, who like
herself had not openly opposed the existing system, but disapproved it;
they were mainly her personal friends, who now took the direction of
affairs into their hands; the change which they prepared looked moderate
but was decided.</p>

<p>Elizabeth rejected the title of 'Supreme Head of the Church,' because it
not merely aroused the aversion of the Catholics, but also gave offence
to many zealous Protestants; it made however no essential difference
when she replaced it by the formula 'in all causes as well
ecclesiastical as civil, supreme.' Parliament declared that the right of
visiting and reforming the Church was attached to the crown and could be
exercised by it through ecclesiastical commissioners. The clergy, high
and low, were to swear to the ecclesiastical supremacy, and abjure all
foreign authority and jurisdiction. The punishment for refusing the oath
was defined: it was not to be punished with death as under Henry VIII,
but with the loss of office and property. All Mary's acts in favour of
an independent legislation and jurisdiction of the spiritualty were
repealed. The crown appropriated to itself, with consent of Parliament,
complete supremacy over the clergy of the land.</p>

<p>The Parliament allowed indeed that it did not belong to it to determine
concerning matters really ecclesiastical; but it held itself authorised,
much like the Great-Councils of Switzerland, to order a conference of
both parties, before which the most pressing questions of the moment, on
the power of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
national Churches, and the nature of the Mass, should be laid.</p>

<p>The Catholic bishops disliked the whole proceeding, as may be imagined,
since these points had been so long settled; and they disliked no less
the interference of the temporal power, and lastly the presidency of a
royal minister, Nicolas Bacon. They had no mind to commit themselves to
an interchange of writings: their declarations by word of mouth were
more peremptory than convincing. In general they were not well
represented since the deaths of Pole and Gardiner. On the other hand the
Protestants, of whom many had become masters of the controverted
questions during the exile from which they had now returned, put forward
explicit statements which were completely to the point. They laid stress
chiefly on the distinction between the universal, truly Catholic, Church
and the Romish: they sought to reach firm ground in Christian antiquity
prior to the hierarchic centuries. While they claimed a more
comprehensive communion than that of Romanism, as that in which true
Catholicity exists, they sought at the same time to establish a
narrower, national, body which should have the right of independent
decision as to ritual. Nearly all depended on the question, how far a
country, which forms a separate community and thus has a separate
Church, has the right to alter established ceremonies and usages; they
deduced such an authority from this fact among others, that the Church
in the first centuries was ruled by provincial councils. The project of
calling a national council was proposed in Germany but never carried
out: in England men considered the idea of a national decree, mainly in
reference to ritual, as superior to all others. But we know how much the
conception of ritual covered. The question whether Edward VI's
Prayer-book should be restored or not, was at the same time decisive as
to what doctrinal view should be henceforth
followed.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>

<p>The Catholic bishops set themselves in vain against the progress of
these discussions. They withdrew from the conference: but the Parliament
did not let itself be misled by this:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
it adopted the popular opinion,
that they did not know what to answer. At the division in the Upper
House they held obstinately fast to their opinion: they were left
however, though only by a few votes, in the
minority.<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>
The Act of Uniformity passed, by which the Prayer-book, in the form which should be
given it by a new revision, was to be universally received from the
following Midsummer. The bishops raised an opposition yet once more, at
a sitting of the Privy Council, on the ground that the change was
against the promises made by Mary to the See of Rome in the name of the
crown. Elizabeth answered, her sister had in this exceeded her powers:
she herself was free to revert to the example of her earlier
predecessors by whom the Papal power was looked on as an usurpation. 'My
crown,' she exclaimed, 'is subject only to the King of Kings, and to no
one else:' she made use of the words, 'But as for me and my house, we
will serve the Lord.' The Protestant bishops had perished at the stake,
but the victory was theirs even in their graves.</p>

<p>The committee of revision consisted of men, who had then saved
themselves by flight or by the obscurity of a secluded life. As under
Edward men came back to the original tendencies prevalent under Henry
VIII, so they now reverted to the settlement under Edward; yet they
allowed themselves some alterations, chiefly with the view of making the
book acceptable to the Catholics as well. Prayers in which the hostility
of decided Protestantism came forward with especial sharpness, for
instance that 'against the tyranny of the Bishop of Rome,' were left
out. The chief alteration was in the formula of the Lord's Supper.
Elizabeth and her divines were not inclined to let this stand as it was
read in the second edition of Edward's time, since the mystical act
there appeared almost as a mere commemorative
repast.<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>
They reverted to a form composed from the monuments of Latin antiquity, from Ambrose
and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
Gregory, in which the real presence was maintained; this which
already existed in the first edition they united with the view of the
second. As formerly in the Augsburg confession in Germany, so in England
at the last recension of the Common Prayer-book an attempt was made to
keep as near as possible to the traditional system. For the Queen this
had also a political value: when Philip II sent her a warning, she
explained that she was only kept back from joining in the mass by a few
points: she too believed in God's presence in the
Sacrament.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>

<p>She was of a similar mind in reference to other matters also. If at
first, under pressure from zealous Protestants who saw in images an
occasion for superstition, she ordered their removal, we perceive that
in a short time she regretted it, especially as it made a bad impression
in Wales and the Northern counties; in her chapel men again saw the
cross and the lighted tapers, as before. The marriages entered into by
priests had given much offence, and not unjustly, as they were often
inferior unions, little honourable to them, and lowering the dignity of
their order. Elizabeth would have gladly forbidden them altogether: she
contented herself with setting limits to them by ordering that a
previous permission should be requisite, but she always disliked them.
She felt a natural pleasure in the splendour and order of the existing
church service. For the future also the spiritualty were to be bound to
appear&mdash;in the customary dress&mdash;in a manner worthy of God's service,
with bent knees and with ceremonious devotion. When they proceeded to
revise the confession drawn up by Cranmer, which two years afterwards
was raised to a law in the shape of the 'Thirty-nine Articles,' they
struck out the places that leant to Zwingli's special view; on the other
hand they added some new propositions, which stated the right of the
higher powers, and the authority of each kingdom to determine religious
usages for
itself.<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
For in this consisted the essence of the alteration, that the Civil
Authority, as it was then composed, decided the church-questions that
arose, and raised its decision into law.</p>

<p>The Statute was, that no person should hold a public office, whether
spiritual or temporal, who did not conform to this law. Thirteen
bishops, four-and-twenty deans, eighty rectors of parishes, and most of
the heads of colleges resigned. It has been said that this number, about
two hundred, is not very considerable, since the English clergy held
9000 benefices and offices; but it comprehended all those who held the
government of the church and represented the prevalent opinion in it.
The difficulty arose how to replace the bishops in conformity with the
principles of the English church constitution as then retained: perhaps
the difficulty was intentional. There were however two conforming
bishops who had received the laying on of hands according to the Roman
ritual, and two others according to the Reformed: these consecrated the
new Archbishop of Canterbury. It was objected to this act that none of
them was in actual possession of a bishop's see: the Queen declared
every defect, whether as to the statutes of the realm or church-usages,
since time and circumstances demanded it, to be nullified or supplied.
It was enough that, generally speaking, the mystery of the episcopal
succession went on without interruption. What was less essential she
supplied by the prerogative of the crown, as her grandfather had done
once before. The archbishop consecrated was Dr. Parker, formerly
chaplain to Anne Boleyn: a thoroughly worthy man, the father of learned
studies on English antiquities, especially on the Anglo-Saxon times. By
him the laying on of hands and consecration was bestowed on the other
bishops who were now elected: they were called on to uphold at the same
time the idea of episcopacy in its primitive import, and the doctrines
of the Reformation.</p>

<p>In regard to the election of bishops also Elizabeth went back one step
from her brother's system; she gave up the right of appointment, and
restored her father's regulations, by which it is true a strong
influence was still reserved for the Civil Power. Under her supreme
authority she wished to see the spiritual principle recognised as such,
and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
to give it a representation corresponding to its high destiny.</p>

<p>Thus it must needs be. The principle which comes forward for the first
time, however strong it may appear, has yet to secure its future: it
must struggle with the other elements of the world around it. It will be
pressed back, perhaps beaten down: but in the vicissitude of the strife
it will develop its inborn strength and establish itself for ever.</p>

<p>An Anglican church,&mdash;nationally independent, without giving up its
connexion with the reformed churches of the continent, and reformed,
without however letting fall the ancient forms of episcopacy,&mdash;in
accordance with the ideal, as it was originally understood, was at
length, after a hard schooling of trials, struggles, and disasters,
really set on foot.</p>

<p>But now it is clear how closely such a thoroughgoing alteration affected
the political position. Reckoning on the antipathies, which could not
but hence arise against Elizabeth in the catholic world, and above all
on the consent of the Roman See, the French did not hesitate to openly
recognise the claims of the Dauphiness Mary Stuart to the English
throne. She was hailed as Queen, when she appeared in public: the
Dauphin's heralds bore the united arms of England, Ireland, and
Scotland.<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>
And this claim became still more important after the
unexpected death of Henry II, when the Dauphin ascended the French
throne as Francis II. The Guises, uncles of Mary the new Queen, who saw
their own greatness in her success and were the very closest adherents
of the church, got into their hands all the powers of government. The
danger of their hostility lay above all in this, that the French already
exercised a predominant influence over Scotch affairs, and hoped in a
short time to become complete masters of that country in the Queen's
right. She moreover had already by a formal document transferred to the
French royal house an eventual right of inheritance to her crown. But if
matters came to this, the old war of England and France would be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
transferred from the fields of Boulogne and Calais to the Scotch border.
An invasion of the English territory from that side was the more
dangerous, as the French would have brought thither, according to their
custom, German and Swiss troops as well. England had neither fortresses,
nor disciplined troops, nor even generals of name, who could face such
an invasion. It was truly said, there was not a wall in England strong
enough to stand a cannon shot.<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a>
How then if a defeat was sustained
in the open field? The sympathies of the Catholics would have been
aroused for France, and general ruin would have ensued.</p>

<p>It was a fortunate thing for Elizabeth that the King of Spain, after she
had taken up a line of conduct so completely counter to his wishes and
ideas, did not make common cause with the French as they requested him.
But she could not promise herself any help from him. Granvella told the
English as emphatically as possible, that they must provide for
themselves. Another Spanish statesman expressed his doubt to them
whether they were able to do so: he really thought England would one day
become an apple of discord between Spain and France, as Milan then was.
It was almost a scoff, to compare the Island that had the power of the
sea with an Italian duchy. But from this very moment she was to take a
new upward flight. England was again to take her place as a third Power
between the two great Powers; the opportunity presented itself to her to
begin open war with one of them, without breaking with the other or even
being exactly allied with it.</p>

<p>At first it was France that threatened and challenged her.</p>

<p>And to oppose the French, at the point where they might be dangerous, a
ready means presented itself; England had but to form an alliance with
those who opposed the French interests in Scotland. As these likewise
were in opposition to their Queen, it was objected that one sovereign
ought not to combine with the subjects of another. Elizabeth's leading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
statesman, William Cecil, who stood ever by her side with his counsel in
the difficulties of her earlier years, and had guided her steps
hitherto, made answer that 'the duty of self-preservation required it in
this case, since Scotland would else be serviceable to France for war
against England.'</p>

<p>Cecil took into his view alike the past and the future. It was France
alone, he said, that had prevented the English crown from realising its
suzerainty over Scotland: whereas the true interest of Scotland herself
lay in her being united with England as one kingdom. This point of view
was all the more important, since the religious interest coincided with
the political. The Scots, with whom they wished to unite themselves,
were Protestants of the most decided kind. </p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class='centersm'><a name="BIII_II" id="BIII_II"></a>
OUTLINES OF THE REFORMATION IN SCOTLAND.</p>

<p>In its earliest period church reform was everywhere introduced or
promoted by the temporal governments; in Germany by the government of
the Empire, and by the Princes and towns which did not allow the
authorisation, once given them through the Empire, to be again
withdrawn; in the North by the new dynasties which took the place of the
Union-Princes; in Switzerland itself by the Great-Councils which
possessed the substance of the republican authority. After manifold
struggles and vicissitudes this tendency had at last yet once more
established itself in its full force under Queen Elizabeth in England.</p>

<p>But another tendency was also very powerful in the world. In South
Europe, France, the Netherlands, and a part of the German territory, the
state attached itself to the principles of the old Church. At this very
time in Italy and Spain this led to the complete destruction of what was
there analogous to the Reformation; it has had more influence on the
later circumstances of these countries than it had then. But where the
religious change had already obtained a more durable footing, as in
France and the Netherlands, politico-religious variances of the most
thoroughgoing nature arose almost of necessity: the Protestantism of
Western Europe was pervaded by anti-monarchical ideas. We noticed how
much everything was preparing for this under Queen Mary in England also:
that it did not so happen was owing to the arrangements made by
Elizabeth. But this tendency appeared in full force in Scotland, and in
fact more strongly there than anywhere else.</p>

<p>In Scotland the efforts made by all the monarchic powers of this period
in common were not so successful as in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
rest of Europe. The kings of
the house of Stuart, who had themselves proceeded from the ranks of the
nobility, never succeeded in reducing the powerful lords to real
obedience. The clannish national feeling, closely bordering on the old
Keltic principle, procured the nobles at all times numerous and devoted
followers: they fought out their feuds among themselves, and then
combined anew in free confederacies. They held fast to the view that
their sovereigns were not lords of the land (for they regarded their
possessions as independent properties), not kings of Scotland but kings
of the Scots, above all, kings of the great vassals, who had to pay them
an obedience defined by laws. It gave the kings not a little superiority
that they had obtained a decisive influence over the appointment to the
high dignities in the Church, but this proved advantageous neither to
the Church nor at last to themselves. Sometimes two vassals actually
fought with each other for a rich benefice. The French abuses came into
vogue here also: ecclesiastical benefices fell to the dependents of the
court, to the younger sons of leading houses, often to their bastards:
they were given or sold <i>in commendam</i>, and then served only for
pleasure and gain: the Scotch Church fell into an exceedingly scandalous
and corrupt state.</p>

<p>It was not so much disputed questions of doctrine as in Germany, nor
again the attempt to keep out Papal influence as in England, but mainly
aversion to the moral corruption of the spiritualty which gave the first
impulse to the efforts at reformation in Scotland. We find Lollard
societies among the Scots much later than in England: their tendencies
spread through wide circles owing to the anticlerical spirit of the
century, and received fresh support from the doctrinal writings that
came over from Germany. But the Scotch clergy was resolved to defend
itself with all its might. Sometimes it had to sit in judgment on
invectives against its disorderly and luxurious life, sometimes on
refusals to pay established dues: or Lutheran doctrines had been
preached: it persecuted all with equal severity as tending to injure the
stability of holy Church, and awarded the most extreme penalties. To put
suspected heretics to death by fire was the order of the day; happy the
man who escaped the unrelenting persecution
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
by flight, which was only possible amid great peril.</p>

<p>These two causes, an undeniably corrupt condition and relentless
punishment of those who blamed it as it well deserved, gave the Reform
movement in Scotland, which was repressed but not stifled, a peculiar
character of exasperation and thirst for vengeance.</p>

<p>Nor was it without a political bearing in Scotland as elsewhere. In
particular Henry VIII proposed to his nephew, King James V, to remodel
the Church after his example: and a part of the nobility, which was
already favourably disposed towards England, would have gladly seen this
done. But James preferred the French pattern to the English: he was kept
firm in his Catholic and French sympathies by his wife, Mary of Guise,
and by the energetic Archbishop Beaton. Hence he became involved in the
war with England in which he fell, and after this it occasionally
seemed, especially at the time of the invasions by the Duke of Somerset,
as if the English, and in connexion with them the Protestant, sympathies
would gain the ascendancy. But national feelings were still stronger
than the religious. Exactly because England defended and recommended the
religious change it failed to make way in Scotland. Under the regency of
the Queen dowager, with some passing fluctuations, the clerical
interests on the whole kept the upper hand. In spite of a general
sympathy the prospects of Reform were slender. It could not reckon on
any quarrel between the government and the higher clergy: foreign
affairs rather exercised a hostile influence. It is remarkable how under
these unfavourable circumstances the foundation of the Scotch Church was
laid.</p>

<p>Most of the Scots who had fled from the country were content to provide
for their subsistence in a foreign land and improve their own culture.
But there was one among them who did not reconcile himself for one
moment to this fate. John Knox was the first who formed a Protestant
congregation in the besieged fortress of S. Andrew's; when the French
took the place in 1547 he was made prisoner and condemned to serve in
the galleys. But while his feet were in fetters, he uttered his
conviction in the fiery preface to a work on Justification, that this
doctrine would yet again be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
preached in his
fatherland.<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>
After he was released, he took a zealous share in the labours of the English
Reformers under Edward VI, but was not altogether content with the
result; after the King's death he had to fly to the continent. He went
to Geneva, where he became a student once more and tried to fill up the
gaps in his studies, but above all he imbibed, or confirmed his
knowledge of, the views which prevailed in that Church. 'Like the first
Reformers of French Switzerland, Knox also lived in the opinion that the
Romish service was an idolatry which should be destroyed from off the
earth. And he was fully convinced of the doctrine of the independence of
the spiritual principle side by side with the State, and believed that
the new spiritualty also was authorised to exclude men from the Church,
views for which Calvin was at that very time contending. Thus he was
equally armed for the struggle against the Papacy and against the
temporal power allied with it, when a transient relaxation of
ecclesiastical control in Scotland made it possible for him to return
thither. In the war between France and Spain the Regent took the side of
France: she lighted bonfires to announce the capture of Calais; out of
antipathy to Mary Tudor and her Spanish government she allowed the
English fugitives to be received in Scotland. Knox himself ventured to
return towards the end of 1555: without delay he set his hand to form a
church-union, according to his ideas of religious independence, which
was not to be again destroyed by any State power.</p>

<p>Among the devout Protestants who gathered together in secret the leading
question was, whether it was consistent with conscience to go to mass,
as most then did. Knox was not merely against any one doing wrong that
good might come of it, but he went on further to restore the interrupted
Protestant service of God. Sometimes in one and sometimes in another of
the places of refuge which he found he administered the Communion to
little congregations according to the Reformed rite; this was done with
greater solemnity at Easter 1556 in the house of Lord Erskine of Dun,
one of those Scottish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
noblemen who had ever promoted literary studies
and the religious movement as far as lay in his power. A number of
people of consequence from the Mearns (Mearnshire) were present. But
they were not content with partaking the Communion; following the mind
of their preacher they pledged themselves to avoid every other religious
community, and to uphold with all their power the preaching of the
Gospel.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>
In this union we may see the origin of the Scotch Church
properly so called. Knox had no doubt that it was perfectly lawful. From
the power which the lords possessed in Scotland he concluded that this
duty was incumbent on them. For they were not lords for themselves, but
in order to protect their subjects and dependents against every
violence. From a distance he called on his friends&mdash;for he had once more
to leave Scotland, since the government recurred to its earlier
severity&mdash;not again to prefer their own ease to the glory of God, but
for very conscience' sake to venture their lives for their oppressed
brethren. At Erskine's house met together also Lord Lorn, afterwards
Earl of Argyle, and the Prior of S. Andrews, subsequently Earl of
Murray; in December 1557 Erskine, Lorn, Murray, Glencairn (also a friend
of Knox), and Morton, united in a solemn engagement, to support God's
word and defend his congregation against every evil and tyrannical power
even unto death.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>
When in spite of this another execution took place
which excited universal aversion, they proceeded to an express
declaration, that they would not suffer any man to be punished for
transgressing a clerical law based on human ordinances.</p>

<p>What the influence of England had not been able to effect, was now
produced by antipathy to France. The opinion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
prevailed that the King of
France wished to add Scotland to his territories, and that the Regent
gave him aid thereto. When she gathered the feudal array on the borders
in 1557 (for the Scots had refused to contribute towards enlisting
mercenaries) to invade England according to an understanding with the
French, the barons held a consultation on the Tweed, in consequence of
which they refused their co-operation for this purpose. The matrimonial
crown was indeed even afterwards granted to the Dauphin, when he married
Mary Stuart;<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a>
but thereupon misunderstandings arose with all the
more bitterness. Meetings were everywhere held in a spirit hostile to
the government.</p>

<p>It was this quarrel of the Regent with the great men of the country that
gave an opportunity to the lords who were combined for the support of
religion to advance with increasing resolution. Among their proposals
there is none weightier than that which they laid before her in March
1559, just when the Regent had gathered around her a numerous
ecclesiastical assembly. They demanded that the bishops should be
elected for the future by the nobility and gentry of each diocese, the
parish clergy by the parishioners, and only those were to be elected who
were of esteemed life and possessed the requisite capacity: divine
service was to be henceforth held in the language of the country. The
assembled clergy rejected both demands. They remarked that to set aside
the influence of the crown on the elections involved a diminution of its
authority which could not be defended, especially during the minority of
the sovereign. Only in the customary forms would they allow of any
amendments.</p>

<p>But this assembly was not content with rejecting the proposals: they
confirmed the usages and services stigmatised by their opponents as
superstitious, and forbade the celebration of the sacraments in any
other form than that sanctioned by the Church. The royal court at
Stirling called a number of preachers to its bar for unauthorised
assumption of priestly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
functions.</p>

<p>The preachers were ready to come: the lords in whose houses they
sojourned were security for them. And already they had the popular
sympathy as well as aristocratic protection. It was an old custom of the
country that, in especially important judicial proceedings, the accused
appeared accompanied by his friends. Now therefore the friends of the
Reformation assembled in great numbers at Perth from the Mearns, Dundee,
and Angus, that, by jointly avowing the doctrines on account of which
their spiritual leaders were called to account, their condemnation might
be rendered impossible.</p>

<p>As to the Regent we are assured that she was not in general firmer in
her leaning towards the hierarchy than other Princes of the time, and
had once even entertained the thought that the supreme ecclesiastical
power belonged to
her;<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a>
but, perhaps alarmed by the vehemence of the
preachers, she had done nothing to obtain such a power. It now appeared
to her that it would be a good plan to check the flow of the masses to
the place of trial by some friendly words which she addressed to Erskine
of Dun.<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>
The Protestants saw in them the assurance of an
interposition in the direction of lenity, and stayed away; but without
regard to this and without delay the Justiciary at Stirling, Henry
Levingstoune, proceeded to business on the day appointed, 20 May 1559.
As the preachers did not appear, those who had become security for them
were condemned to a money-fine, while they themselves were denounced as
rebels,<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>
as having withdrawn themselves from the royal jurisdiction;
an edict followed which pronounced them exiled, and in the severest
terms forbade any to give them protection or favour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
The news fell like a spark of fire among the inflammable masses of
Protestants assembled at Perth. The sentence promulgated was an open act
of hostility against the lords, who felt themselves bound by their word
which they had given to the preachers and by their vow to each other.
They considered that the Regent's promise had given them a right against
her; Lord Erskine, whom the others had warned, declared that he had been
deceived by her. While the Regent had prevented a collision between the
two parties at Stirling, she had occasioned in one of them, at Perth,
the outbreak of a popular storm against the hierarchy of the land, their
representatives, and the monuments of their religion. John Knox, who had
come, as he said, to be where men were striving against Satan, called on
them in a fiery sermon to destroy the images which were the instruments
of idolatry. The attempt of a priest, after the sermon, to proceed to
high mass and open the tabernacle of the altar, was all that was needed
to cause a tumult even in the church itself, in which the images of the
saints were destroyed; and the outbreak spreading through the city
directed itself against the monasteries and laid them too in ruins. How
entirely different is Knox from Luther! The German reformer made all
outward change depend on the gradual influence of doctrine, and did not
wish to set himself in rebellious opposition to the public order under
which he lived. The Scot called on men to destroy whatever contravened
his religious ideas. The Lords of the Congregation, who became ever more
numerous, declared themselves resolved to do all that God commands in
Scripture, and destroy all that tended to dishonour his name. With these
objects, and with their co-operation and connivance, the stormy movement
once raised surged everywhere further over the country. The monasteries
were also destroyed in Stirling, Glasgow, and S. Andrews; the abbeys of
Melrose, Dunfermline, and Cambuskenneth fell: and the proud abbey of
Scone, an incomparable monument of the hierarchic feeling of earlier
ages, was, together with the bishop's palace, levelled to the ground. It
may be that the popular fury went far beyond the original intentions of
the leaders, but without doubt it was also part of their purpose, to
make an end above all of the monasteries and abbeys,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
from which nothing but resistance could be
expected.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>
It has been regarded even in our
days as a measure of prudence, dictated by the circumstances, that they
destroyed these monuments, which by their imposing size and the
splendour of the service performed in them would have always produced an
impression adverse to the Reformation. On the other hand the cathedrals
and parish churches were to be preserved, and after being cleansed from
images were to be devoted to Protestant worship. Everywhere the
church-unions, which were at once formed and organised on Protestant
principles, gained the upper hand. The Mass ceased: the Prayer-book of
King Edward VI took its place.</p>

<p>So the reformed Scotch Church put itself in possession, in a moment, of
the greatest part of the country. It was from the beginning a
self-governed establishment: it found support in the union of some
lords, whose power likewise rested on independent rights: but it first
gained free play when the French policy of the Regent alienated the
nobility and the nation from her. On the one side now stood the princess
and the clergy, on the other the lords and the preachers. As their
proposals were rejected and preparations made to defend the hierarchic
system with the power of the State, the opposition also similarly arose,
claiming to have an original right: revolt broke out; the church system
of the Romish hierarchy was overthrown and a Protestant one put in its
place. In the history of Protestantism at large the year 1559 is among
the most important. During the very days in which the revised Common
Prayer-book was restored in England (so definitely putting an end to the
Catholic religion of the realm), the monuments of Roman Catholicism in
Scotland were broken in pieces, and the unrevised Common Prayer-book
introduced into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
churches. But yet how great was the difference! In
the one country all was done under the guidance of a Queen to whom the
nation adhered, in consequence of Parliamentary enactments, the ancient
forms being preserved as far as possible: here the whole transaction was
completed in opposition to the Regent, under the guidance of an
aristocracy engaged in conflict with her, amidst very great tumult,
while all that was ancient was set aside.</p>

<p>At the beginning of July the Scotch lords had become masters of the
capital as well, and had reformed it according to their own views, with
the most lively sympathy of the citizens. They were resolved to uphold
the change of religion now effected, cost what it would, and hoped to do
so in a peaceful manner. When Perth again opened her gates to the Regent
after the first tumult, under the condition that she should punish no
one, she promised at the same time to put off the adjustment of all
questions in dispute to the next Parliament. There they intended to
carry at once the recognition of the Reformation in its whole breadth,
and the removal of the French. We perceive that it was their plan in
that case to obey the Regent as before, and to unite the abbey-lands to
the possessions of the crown. 'But if your Grace does not agree to
this,' so runs the letter of a confederate, 'they are resolved to reject
all union with you.'</p>

<p>It was soon shown that the last was the only alternative. The regent
collected so many French and Scotch troops that the lords did not
venture to stop her return to Edinburgh. They came to an agreement
instead, in which she promised to prosecute no member of the
Congregation, and especially no preacher, and not to allow the clergy on
the ground of their jurisdiction to undertake any annoying proceedings:
in return for which the lords on their side pledged themselves not to
disturb any of the clergy or destroy any more of the church buildings.
It was a truce in which each party, sword in hand, reserved to itself
the power of defending its partisans against the other. The two parties
encountered in Edinburgh. The inhabitants had called Knox to be their
preacher, and when he thought it unsafe to stay in the city after the
Congregation withdrew, another
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
champion of the Reformation, Willok,
filled his place with hardly less zeal and success. But on the other
side the bishop of Amiens appeared with some doctors of the Sorbonne at
the Regent's court. Here and there the Protestant service was again
discarded; the Paris theologians defended the old dogma among the Scotch
scholars, and made even now some impression; the mass and the preaching
contended with each other. As to the Regent's views there can be no
doubt. She drew the attention of the French court to the frequent
intercourse between the nobles of Protestant views in France and
Scotland, and to the encouragement the Scots had from the French; but
she gave the assurance that she would soon finish with the Scots if she
received support. Some French companies had just landed at Leith, they
had brought with them munitions of war and money: the Regent demanded
four companies more, to make up twenty, and perhaps 100 hommes d'armes;
if only four French ships were stationed at Leith to keep off foreign
assistance, she pledged herself to put down the movement
everywhere.<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p>

<p>Then the Scots also decided that they must employ their utmost means of
resistance. They had framed politico-religious theories, in virtue of
which they believed in their right to do so. The substance of the whole
is that they acknowledged indeed an obligation on the conscience which
required obedience to the sovereign, but at the same time they held that
the obligation came to an end as soon as the sovereign contravened the
known will of God: an idolatrous sovereign, so said the preachers, could
be deposed and punished:&mdash;should the supreme Head put off the reform
which was required by God's law, the right and the duty of executing it
falls on the subordinate authorities.</p>

<p>But the lords claimed also an authority based on the laws of the land.
When the French troops began to fortify Leith, they held themselves
justified in raising remonstrances against it: they demanded that the
Regent should desist from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
the design. As she replied with a
proclamation which sounded very offensive to themselves, they had no
scruple in taking up arms. Each noble collected his men round him and
appeared at their head in the field. Relying on the fine army which was
thus brought together, they repeated their demand, with the remark, that
in receiving foreign troops into the harbour-town there was involved a
manifest attempt to enslave the land by force: if the Regent would not
lend an ear to their remonstrances, they being the hereditary
councillors of the crown, they would remember their oath which bound
them to provide for the general welfare. The Regent expressed her
astonishment to the lords through a herald that there should be any
other authority in the realm than that of her daughter, the Queen. She
already felt herself strong enough to order them and their troops to
disperse, on pain of the punishment appointed for high treason. On this
the great men met in the old council-house at Edinburgh, to consider the
question whether it was obligatory to pay obedience to a princess, who
was but regent, and who disregarded the opinion of the hereditary
councillors of the crown. The consultation, at which some preachers
supported the views of the lords with similar arguments, ended in the
declaration that the Regent no longer possessed an authority which she
was using to the damage of the realm. In the name of the King and Queen
they announced to her that the commission she had received from them was
at an end. 'And as your Grace,' so they continued, 'will not acknowledge
us as your councillors, we also will no longer acknowledge you as our
regent.'<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

<p>To this pass matters had now come. The combined interests, on the one
side of the crown and the clergy, on the other of the lords and the
Protestants, came into open and avowed conflict. The Act of Suspension
is but the proclamation of war in a form which would enable them to
avoid directly breaking with their duties towards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>their born prince.</p>

<p>The lords' first enterprise was directed against the French troops which
held Leith in their possession, and which were now first of all to be
driven out of the country: but the hastily-constructed fortifications
there proved stronger than was expected. And not merely were their
assaults on Leith repelled, but the Lords soon saw themselves driven
from their strongest positions, for instance from Stirling; their
possessions were wasted far and wide; the war, which was transferred to
Fife, took an unfortunate turn for them; to all appearance they were
lost if they did not obtain help from abroad.</p>

<p>But to whom could they apply for it if not to their neighbour, just now
rising in power, Elizabeth Queen of England?</p>

<p>They might have hesitated, as they had indeed repelled the influence of
Henry VIII and of Somerset, even when it was united with reforming
tendencies. But how entirely different were matters now from what they
had been then! With their own hands they had already given themselves a
Protestant church-system, which was national in a high degree, and
somewhat opposite to the English one. So long as it existed, the
influence England would gain by giving them help could never become the
supremacy, at which it is certain attempts had previously been made.</p>

<p>We know too the objections which were made in England against a union
with the Scots. To these were added the Queen's decided antipathies to
the new form of church government and to its leaders: she could not bear
the mention of Knox's name. But all these considerations disappeared
before the pressing danger and the political necessity. In opposition to
France, Protestant England and Protestant Scotland, however different
the religious and even the political tendencies prevailing in each of
them, held out their hands to each other.</p>

<p>Elizabeth had already at an earlier time privately given the Scots some
support: the moment at which she gave them decisive assistance is worth
noticing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
The Regent's French and Scotch troops were planning an attack on S.
Andrews, and had made themselves masters of Dysarts; the lords, again
retreating, marched along the coast, and the French were in pursuit when
a fleet hove in sight in the distance. The French welcomed it with
salvos of cannon, for they had no doubt that it was their own fleet,
bringing them help from France, long expected, and now in fact known to
be ready. But it soon appeared that they were English vessels, in
advance of the larger fleet which had put to sea under Vice-admiral
Winter. Nothing remained for the French, when thus undeceived, but to
give up their project and withdraw. But the whole state of things was
thus altered. Soon after this the Scots, to whose assistance English
troops had also come by land, were able to advance against Leith and
resume the suspended siege.</p>

<p>Everything that is to come to pass in the world has its right time and
hour. Incredible as it may seem, the champion of the strictest
Catholicism, the King of Spain, was at this moment not merely for help
being given to the Scots, but pressing for it; his ministers complained
not that the Queen interfered, but that she did not do so more quickly.
For in the union of Scotland and France, which was already complete in a
military sense, they saw a danger for themselves. The enthusiastic Knox,
who only lived and moved in religious ideas, was, more than he foresaw,
a link in the chain of European affairs. Without the impulse which he
gave to the minds of men, that resistance to the Regent, by which a
complete union with France was hindered, would have been impossible.</p>

<p>A treaty was made in Berwick between Queen Elizabeth and the Scotch
lords, by which they bound themselves to drive the French out of
Scotland with their united strength. The lords promised to remain
obedient to their Queen, but Elizabeth assented to the additional words,
that this was not to be in such cases as might lead to the overthrow of
the old Scottish rights and liberties. This was a very comprehensive
clause, which placed the further attempts of the Scotch lords against
the monarchical power under English protection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
While the siege of Leith was being carried on by land and sea,
commissioners from France appeared on the part of Queen Mary Stuart and
her husband, as they had now assumed the place of the Regent (who had
died in the midst of these troubles), to attempt to bring about an
agreement. The chief among them was Monluc, bishop of Valence, a
well-meaning and moderate man even in religious matters, who, convinced
of the impossibility of carrying on the war any further with success,
gave way step by step before the inflexible purpose of the English
plenipotentiary, William Cecil. He put his hand to the treaty of
Edinburgh, in which the withdrawal of the French troops from Scotland
and the destruction of the fortifications of Leith were stipulated for.
This satisfied the chief demand of the lords, and at the same time
agreed with the wish of the neighbouring Power. The King and Queen of
France and Scotland were no longer to bear the title and arms of England
and Ireland. For Scotland a provisional government was arranged on the
basis of election by the Estates; it was settled that for the future
also the Queen and King should decide on war and peace only by their
advice. It is easy to see how much a limitation of the Scotch crown was
connected with the interests of the Power that was injured by its union
with the crown of France.</p>

<p>Religion was not expressly mentioned; Queen Elizabeth had purposely
avoided it. But when the Scotch Parliament, to which the adjustment of
the matters in dispute was once more referred in the treaty of
Edinburgh, now met, nothing else could be expected than what in fact
happened. The Protestant Confession was accepted almost without
opposition, the bishops' jurisdiction declared to be abolished according
to the view of the confederate lords, the celebration of the Mass not
only forbidden, but, after the example of Geneva, prohibited under the
severest penalties.</p>

<p>How mightily had the self-governing church-society, founded three years
and a half before in the castle at Dun, secured its foothold! By its
union with the claims of the aristocracy it had broken up the existing
government not merely of the Church but also of the State. It was of
unspeakable importance for the subsequent fortunes of England that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span> this
vigorous living element had been taken under the protection of the Queen
of that country and supported by her.</p>

<p>But at the same time, if we may so say, it complicated her personal
relations inextricably. </p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class='centersm'><a name="BIII_III" id="BIII_III"></a>
MARY STUART IN SCOTLAND. RELATION OF THE TWO QUEENS TO EACH OTHER.</p>

<p>People were now fully satisfied that they had obtained something great,
and had laid a firm foundation for secure relations throughout all
future time: but it became clear at once that this was not the case.
Francis II and his wife seemed to have forgotten that they had promised
on their royal word, in the instructions to their ambassadors, to accept
whatever they should arrange: they refused to ratify the treaty of
Edinburgh. For it was really concluded by the Queen of England with men
in rebellion against them, by whom it was chiefly subscribed. They
regarded it as an insult that the Scots deputed an embassy of great
lords to England, whilst the request to confirm all that was arranged in
Scotland was laid before them, their Queen and their King, by a
gentleman of less distinguished birth. They felt themselves highly
injured by a Parliament being called even before they had ratified the
treaty, without any authorisation on their side. How were they to accept
its resolutions? Francis II on the contrary said, he would prove to the
Scots that they had no power to meet together in their own name, just as
if they were a republic.<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>
And as little was he inclined to give up
the title and arms of England according to the treaty: he said he had
hitherto borne them with good right, and saw no reason to give
satisfaction to others, before he had received any himself.</p>

<p>Those were the days in which the French government, guided by the
Queen's uncles, including the Cardinal of Lorraine, had considerably
repressed the Protestant movements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span> which were stirring in France, had
brought the insurgent princes into its power, and was occupied in
establishing a strict system of obedience in ecclesiastical and
political matters; with kindred aims it sought in Scotland also to
revert to its earlier policy; all concessions made to the contrary it
ignored. I see here, says the English ambassador Throckmorton, more
intention of vengeance than inclination to peace.</p>

<p>At this juncture occurred the unexpected event which gave French affairs
another shape. King Francis II died at the beginning of December 1559
without issue; and the Guises could not maintain the authority they had
hitherto possessed. The kingdom which, by the extent and unity of its
power, was wont to exercise a dominant influence over all others, fell
into religious and political troubles which engrossed and broke up its
force.</p>

<p>Elizabeth took some part also in these movements within France itself:
it was her natural policy to support the opponents of the Guises, who
likewise stood so near her in their religious confession. With their
consent she once occupied Havre, but allowed it without much hesitation
to fall again into the hands of the French government which was then
guided by Catharine Medici, who for some time even made common cause
with the leaders of the Huguenots. We cannot here follow out these
relations any further, for to understand them fully would require us to
go into the details of the changeful dissensions in France: for English
history these are only so far important as they made it impossible for
the French to act upon England.</p>

<p>On the other hand the entire sequel of English history turns on the
relation to Scotland: Scotch affairs already form a constituent part of
the English, and demand our whole attention.</p>

<p>At first sight it would not have seemed so impossible to bring about
peace and even friendship between the Queen of Scotland and the Queen of
England: for the former was of course no longer bound to the interests
of the French crown. But this expectation also proved deceitful. A
primary condition would have been the acceptance of the treaty of
Edinburgh;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
Elizabeth demanded this expressly and as if it were
obligatory on Mary, who would as little consent to it after, as before,
the death of her husband. She ceased to bear the arms of England: all
else she deferred till her arrival in Scotland. Immediately on this, at
the first step, the mutual antipathy broke
out.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a>
In consequence of
the refusal to ratify the treaty, Elizabeth declined Mary's request to
be allowed to return home through England. Mary regarded this as an
insult: it is worth while to hear her words. 'I was once,' so she said,
'brought to France in spite of all the opposition of her brother: I will
return to Scotland without her leave. She has combined with my
rebellious subjects: but there are also malcontents in England who would
listen to a proposal from my side with delight: I am a Queen as well as
she, and not altogether friendless, and perhaps I have as great a soul
too.'</p>

<p>Few words, but they contain motives of jealousy rising out of the depths
of her inmost heart and announce a stormy future. But at first Mary
could not give effect to them.</p>

<p>Some Catholic lords did indeed request her to come to them in the
northern counties, whence they would escort her to her capital with an
armed force. But who could advise her to begin her government with a
civil war? She would then have herself driven the Protestant lords over
to the side of her foe. But she had connexions with them as well. Their
leader, her half-brother James, Prior of S. Andrews, whom she now
created Earl of Murray, a man of spirit, energy, and comprehensive
views, appeared before her in France; his experience and caution and
even the inner tie of blood-relationship always gave him a great
influence over her resolutions. He showed her how it was possible to
rule Scotland even under existing circumstances, so as to have a
tolerable understanding with Elizabeth, but reserving all else for the
future. These counsels she followed. Not with Elizabeth's help, but yet
without hindrance from her, she arrived at Holyrood in August 1561.
Murray succeeded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
in obtaining, though not without great opposition, and
almost by personally keeping off opponents, that she should be allowed
to have mass celebrated before her. He took affairs into his own hands;
the Protestants had the ascendancy in the country and in the royal
council.</p>

<p>Not that Queen Mary by this fully acquiesced in what had happened, or
recognised the state of affairs in Scotland. She even now confirmed
neither the treaty of Edinburgh, nor the resolutions of Parliament based
on it: but in the first place took possession of her throne, reserving
her dynastic rights.</p>

<p>A sight without a parallel, these two Queens in Albion, haughty and
wondrous creatures of nature and circumstances!</p>

<p>They were both of high mental culture. From Mary we have French poems,
of a truth of feeling and a simplicity of language, which were then rare
in literature. Her letters are fresh and eloquent effusions of momentary
moods and wishes: they impress us even if we know that they are not
exactly true. She has pleasure in lively discussion, in which she
willingly takes a playful, sometimes a familiar, tone; but always shows
herself equal to the subject. From Elizabeth also we have some lines in
verse, not exactly of a poetic strain, not very harmonious in
expression, but full of high thoughts and resolves. Her letters are
skilful but, owing to their allusions and antitheses, far from
perspicuous products of reflection, although succinct and rich in
matter. She was acquainted with the learned languages, had studied the
ancient classics and translated one or two, had read much of the
church-fathers: in her expressions there sometimes appears an insight
into the inner connexion between history and ideas, which fills us with
astonishment. In conversation she tried above all things to produce a
sense of her gifts and accomplishments. She shone through a combination
of grandeur and condescension which appeared like grace and sweetness,
and sometimes awakened a personal homage, for which in the depths of her
soul she cherished a longing. She did but toy with such feelings, to
Mary they were a reality. Mary possessed that natural power of womanly
charm which awakens
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
strong, even if not lasting, passion. Her personal
life fluctuates between the wish to find a husband who could advance her
interests and those passionate ebullitions by which she is also herself
overpowered. This however does not hinder her from devoting all her
attention to the business of government. Both Queens work with like zeal
in their Privy Council: and they only deliberate with men of intimate
trust; the resolutions which are adopted are always their own. Elizabeth
yields more to the wisdom of tried councillors, though even these are
not sure of her favour for a moment, and have a hard place of it with
her. Mary fluctuates between full devotion and passionate hate: she is
almost always swayed by an unlimited confidence in the man who meets her
wishes. Elizabeth lets things come to her: Mary is ever restless and
enterprising.<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a>
Elizabeth appeared once in the field, to animate the
courage of her troops in a great peril. Mary took a personal share in
the local Scottish feuds: she was seen riding at the head of a small
feudal army against the enemy, with pistols at her saddle-bow.</p>

<p>But we here discontinue this representation of the antitheses of
character between them, which first acquired historical import through
the differences of position in which the two sovereigns found
themselves.</p>

<p>Elizabeth was mistress of her State, as well in its religious as its
political constitution. She had revived the obedience once paid to her
father; and remodelled the Church in the decidedly Protestant spirit
which corresponded to her personal position; at first every man
submitted to the new order of things, though many looked on its growth
only with aversion. Mary on the contrary had to accommodate herself to a
form of Church, and even of State, government, which was founded in
opposition to the right of her predecessors, and above all to her own
views. If she ever thought of making her own religion predominant, or of
oppressing that which was newly established, open resistance was
announced to her in threatening
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
terms by its leader John Knox. However
much this reaction against her religious belief straitened her on the
one side, yet on another side it opened out to her a wider prospect. She
already had numerous personally devoted partisans in Great Britain, both
in Scotland where she could yet once more call them together, and in
England where she was secretly regarded by not a few as the lawful
Queen; but, besides this, she had many in Catholic Europe, which had
become reunited during these years (the times when the Council of Trent
was drawing to a close) around the Papal authority, and was preparing to
bring back those who had fallen away. This great confederacy gave Mary a
position which made her capable of confronting a neighbour in herself so
much more powerful.</p>

<p>Elizabeth once touched on the old claims of England to supremacy over
Scotland: the ambition of all the Scotch kings, to prove to the English
that they were independent of them, still lived in Mary: when queen was
set over against queen, it took a more sharply-expressed shape; any
whisper of subjection seemed to her an outrage.</p>

<p>For the moment Mary had, as before mentioned, given up the title of
'Queen of England': but all her thoughts were directed towards the point
of getting her presumptive hereditary right to that kingdom recognised,
and of preparing for its realisation at a later time.</p>

<p>But now there were two ways by which she might gain her end. She might
either get her claim to the English throne recognised by an agreement
with its present possessor, which did not appear so unattainable, as
Elizabeth was unmarried, and such a settlement would have been legally
valid in England; or she might enter into a dynastic alliance with a
neighbouring great power, so as to be enabled to carry her claims into
effect one day through its military
strength.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p>

<p>With this last view negociations were during several years carried on
for a marriage with Don Carlos the son of the Spanish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
King. For in the same proportion that the union of Scotch and French interests dissolved,
did the opposite alliance between Spain and England become looser. The
most varied reasons made Philip II wish to enter into direct and close
relations with Scotland. Immediately after the death of Francis II, a
negociation was set on foot with a view to this alliance, on Mary's
giving an audience to the Spanish ambassador, to the vexation of Queen
Catharine of France, who wished to see this richest of princes, and the
one who seemed destined to the greatest power, reserved for her own
youngest daughter. After Mary returned to Scotland similar rumours were
renewed, and from time to time we meet with a negociation for this
object. When her minister Lethington was in London in the spring of
1563, he agreed with the Spanish ambassador that this marriage was the
only desirable one: it was longed for by all Scotch and English
Catholics. Soon afterwards the ambassador sent a young member of the
embassy to Scotland, in the deepest secrecy, by a long circuit through
Ireland; not without difficulty he obtained an interview with Mary
Stuart, in which he assured himself of her inclination for the marriage.
In the autumn of 1563 Catharine Medici showed herself well informed
about this negociation and much disquieted by
it.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a>
It appeared to depend only on Philip's decision whether the marriage was concluded or
not.<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>
After some time the Scotch Privy Council sent the bishop of
Ross to Spain, to bring the matter about. The Queen herself corresponded
on it with Cardinal Granvella and the Duchess of Arschot.</p>

<p>Don Carlos was too weak, too morbidly excited, to be married when young.
King Philip, who did not wish to feed his ambition, at last gave the
plan up, and recommended, instead of his son, his nephew the Archduke
Charles of Austria.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
But the one was as disagreeable to the English court as the other.
Elizabeth had announced eternal enmity to Queen Mary if she married a
prince of the house of Austria. Besides, the Spanish influence in
England troubled her: she now saw herself already under the necessity of
demanding and enforcing the recall of the Spanish ambassador, because he
drew the Catholic party round him and incited them to oppose the laws of
England. What might have come of it, if a prince of this house should
now obtain rule over a part of the island itself?</p>

<p>But while Mary through these secret negociations tried to obtain the
support of a great Catholic house for her claims, she neglected nothing
that could contribute at the same time to make a good and friendly
understanding with Queen Elizabeth possible, and to bring it about. In
the company of her half-brother Murray, who held the reins of government
with a firm hand, supported by his religious and political friends, she
undertook a campaign into the Northern counties (which inclined to
Catholicism), to make them submit to the universal law of the land. Only
one priest was allowed at court, from whom she heard mass; some of those
who read the mass elsewhere were occasionally punished for it; clergymen
who complained of the hardship they experienced were referred to Murray.
This proceeding too was only temporary, it was intended to incline the
Queen of England to her wishes. All quarrel was carefully avoided: on
solemn festivals she drank to the English ambassador, to the health of
his mistress. Besides, there were negociations for a meeting of the two
Queens in person at York, where Mary hoped to be solemnly recognised as
presumptive heiress of
England.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a>
However much it otherwise lies
beyond the mental horizon of this epoch of firm and mutually opposed
convictions, Mary was then thought capable of willingly adopting the
forms of the English Church; to this even the Cardinal of Lorraine had
assented. She herself unceasingly declared that she wished to honour
Elizabeth as a mother, as an elder sister. But the Queen of England,
after all sorts of promises, preparations, and delays, declined the
interview. She would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
hear absolutely nothing of any recognition of the
claim of inheritance. With naive plainness she inferred that such a
declaration would not lead 'to concord with her sister, the Queen of
Scotland,' since naturally a sovereign does not love his heir;&mdash;how
indeed could that be possible, since every one is wont to make the heir
the object of his aim and hopes;&mdash;she might increase Mary's importance
by the recognition, but at the same time she would undermine her
own;&mdash;whether Mary had a right to the English throne, she did not know
and did not even wish to know: for she was (and as she said this, she
pointed to the ring on her finger in proof) married to the people of
England; if the Queen of Scotland had a right to the English throne,
that should be left to her unimpaired.</p>

<p>And none could deny that such a declaration as Mary required had its
hazardous side for Elizabeth. Henry VIII's settlement of the succession,
on which Elizabeth's own accession rested, excluded the Scotch line: in
virtue of it the descendants of the younger sister, who were natives of
England, possessed a greater right. And how if the Queen of Scots, when
recognised as heir to England, afterwards gave her hand to a Catholic
prince hostile to Elizabeth? The dangers indicated above would then be
doubled, the followers of the ancient Church would have attached
themselves to the royal couple, and formed a compact party in opposition
to Elizabeth's arrangements, which would never have attained stability.</p>

<p>To meet this very objection, it was suggested that Mary might marry a
Protestant, in fact Robert Dudley Earl of Leicester, who was looked upon
as the favourite of the Queen of England herself. Elizabeth could have
been quite secure of him: she herself recommended him. Mary was at the
first moment unpleasantly affected by the idea that she was expected to
take as a husband one who was a born subject of England; but she was by
no means decidedly against it, always supposing that in that case
Elizabeth would recognise her right of inheritance in a valid form for
herself and her issue by this marriage. Above all men Murray was in
favour of this. He said, although his power
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
must be diminished by the
Queen's union with Leicester, yet he wished for it, in so far as it was
bound up with the confirmation of the heirship; for that was the hope by
which he had kept Mary firm to the existing system, and separated her
from her old friends all these years past. Such was without doubt the
case: it is this point of view that renders Mary's policy and conduct
during the last years intelligible. If he, so Murray continued, could
not make his promise good, Mary would think he had deceived her: should
she afterwards marry a Catholic prince, what would be their
position?<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a>
Once more was the request brought before Queen Elizabeth.
But even under these circumstances she could not be induced to grant it.
She said, if Mary trusted her and married Leicester, she should never
repent it: but these words, which contained no definite engagement, had
rather an opposite effect on Mary. In the hope of the recognition of her
heirship she had hitherto endured the absolute constraint of her
position: she would even have agreed to the choice of a husband by which
she feared to be disparaged and controlled: for how could she have
concealed from herself, that by it she would have fallen into a
permanent dependence on the policy of England? With all her compliances
and advances she had nevertheless gained nothing. Her vexation relieved
itself by a violent outburst of tears: but during this inward storm she
decided at the same time to drop her union with Elizabeth, and thus
leave herself free for an opposite policy.</p>

<p>She had refused the Archduke because his possessions were too small to
secure her ends, too distant for him to be able to help her. Then
another suitor presented himself for her hand, who would not indeed
bring her any increase of power, but would strengthen her claims, which
seemed to her very desirable. This was the young Henry Lord Darnley,
through his mother likewise a descendant of Henry VII's daughter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
who had married in Scotland, and through his father Matthew Earl of Lennox
related to that family of the Stuarts which was descended from
Alexander, a younger son of James Stuart the ancestor of the Scotch
kings. In his descent there lay a double recommendation for him. It was
remarked also that he had in his favour in Scotland itself the numerous
and important Stuarts (Lord Athol too belonged to them); but mainly that
a scion of this marriage would not find in England any rival of similar
claims, which might be easily the case if young Darnley should marry
into a family of the English nobility and bring it his
rights.<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>
Darnley was a youth remarkable for his fine figure, tall and well built;
he made a great impression on the Queen at his very first appearance. In
July 1565 the marriage was celebrated and Henry Darnley proclaimed King:
the heralds named his name first, when they delivered the royal
proclamations.</p>

<p>He had hitherto, at least publicly, held to the Protestant faith: even
now he occasionally attended the preaching: but after a little wavering
he avowed himself a Catholic and drew over a number of lords with him by
his example. The Catholic interest thus obtained a complete ascendancy
at court.</p>

<p>And now Mary did not delay a moment longer in making decisive advances
to the Catholic powers. She had in fact no need to fear that the King of
Spain would be offended at her refusing his nephew, if she attached
herself to him in other matters. When she announced her marriage to him,
she not merely requested him to interest himself for her and her
husband's claims in England; she designated him as the man whom God had
raised up above all others to defend the holy Catholic religion, and
asked for his help to enable her to withstand the apostates in her
kingdom: as long as she lived, she would join him against all and every
enemy.<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a>
This quite fell in with the ideas which Philip himself
cherished. From the park of Segovia in October 1565 he commissioned
Cardinal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
Pacheco to reassure the Pope with the declaration that he
meant to support the Queen of Scots not less than the Pope himself. In
this they must, he remarked, keep three points in view: first the
subjugation of her rebellious subjects, which he thought not difficult,
as Elizabeth would not support them; then the restoration of the
Catholic Church in Scotland, than which nothing would give him greater
satisfaction; lastly, the most difficult of all, the obtaining the
recognition of her right to the English throne: in all this he would
support the Queen with his counsel and with money: he could not however
come forward himself, it could only be done in the Pope's
name.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>

<p>The ordinary accounts of the conferences at Bayonne have proved
erroneous, as the proposals which were certainly made there by the
Spaniards were not accepted. But Philip II's resolutions seem not less
comprehensive in this case; these were his hostility to Queen Elizabeth,
still concealed from the world but fully clear to his own consciousness,
and his resolve to do everything in his power to place Mary, if not now,
yet at a future time on the English throne. The great movement he was
designing was to begin from Scotland. Like the Guises at a later time,
so now Mary and her partisans in England and Scotland, if he supported
her, were to be instruments in his hand.</p>

<p>Mary had the good fortune to break up the seditious combination of some
lords who opposed her marriage. Strengthened by this she prepared for
quite a different state of things. She received money from Spain: Pope
Pius V had promised to support her as long as he had a single chalice to
dispose of. She expected disciplined Italian troops from him: artillery
and other munitions of war were brought together for her in the
Netherlands. Leaning on Rome and Spain the spirited Queen hoped to
become capable of any great
enterprise.<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<p>It was clearly to be expected that she would unite a political tendency
with the religious one. In the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
letter quoted above Philip reminds her
how dangerous to monarchy were the doctrines of the pretended
Gospellers:<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>
opinions like those which Knox, regardless of all else,
put before her personally, as to the limitations of royal power
justified by religion, she as a matter of course would not endure. It is
more surprising to find that she also called in question the rights
which the nobility claimed as against the royal government, assigning a
sort of theoretic ground for her view. The nobles base them, so she
said, on the services of their ancestors; but if the children have
renounced their virtue, neglect honour, care only for their families,
despise the King and his laws and commit treason, must the sovereign
even then still let his power be limited by theirs? How vast were the
plans which this Queen entertained&mdash;to restore Catholicism in Scotland,
to resume the war against the nobility in which her ancestors had
failed, to overthrow the Protestant opinions, and therewith to become
one day Queen of England!</p>

<p>Among those around her was an Italian, David Riccio of Poncalieri in
Piedmont, who had previously been secretary to the Archbishop of Turin,
and then in the same capacity accompanied his brother-in-law, the Conte
di Moretta, who went to Scotland as ambassador of the Duke of Savoy. He
knew how to express himself well in Italian and French, and was besides
skilful in music.<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a>
As he exactly supplied a voice which was wanting
in the Queen's chapel, she asked the ambassador to let him enter her
service. Riccio was not a blooming handsome man; though still young, he
gave the impression of advanced years: he had something morose and
repellent about him; but he showed himself endlessly useful and zealous,
and won greater influence from day to day. He not merely conducted the
foreign correspondence, on which all now depended and for which he was
indispensable,&mdash;it became his office to lay everything before the Queen
that needed her signature, and through this he attained the incalculable
actual power of a confidential cabinet-secretary;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
he saw the Queen, who
took pleasure in his company, as often as he wished, and ate at her
table. James Melvil, whom she had commissioned to warn her, if he saw
her committing faults, did not neglect doing it in this case; he
represented to her the ill effects which favouring a foreigner drew
after it: but she thought she could not let her royal prerogative be so
narrowly limited.<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a>
Riccio had promoted the marriage with Darnley:
the latter seemed to depend on
him;<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a>
it was even said that the
secretary used at pleasure a signet bearing the King's initials. It was
no wonder indeed if this influence created him enemies, especially as he
took presents which streamed in on him abundantly: yet the real
hostility came from quite another quarter.</p>

<p>The English Council of State did not fail to notice the danger which lay
in a policy of estrangement on the part of Scotland. It was proposed to
put an end to its progress once for all by an invasion of Scotland: or
at least the wish was expressed to arm for defence, e.g. to fortify
Berwick, and above all to renew the understanding with the Scotch lords;
Murray, whom Mary had in vain tried to gain over by reminding him of the
interest of their family and the views of their father, would most
gladly have delivered Darnley at once into the hands of the English. By
thus openly choosing his side he had been forced, together with his
chief friends, Chatellerault, Glencairn, Rothes, and some others, to
leave Scotland: the Queen, refused with violent words the demand of the
English court that she should receive them again; she called a
Parliament instead for the beginning of March, in which their banishment
was to be confirmed and an attempt made to restore Catholicism. This was
not so difficult, as the resolutions of 1560 had never yet been
ratified. There appeared at court the Catholic lords, Huntley, Athol,
and Bothwell who was ever ready for fighting (he had returned from
banishment); they came to an understanding with Riccio. But now it
happened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
that the personal union (on which all rested) between the
King, the Queen, and the powerful secretary changed to discord. Darnley,
who wished not merely to be called King but to be King, demanded that
the matrimonial crown should be conferred on him by the Parliament; this
would have given him independent rights. The Queen on her side wished to
keep the supreme power undiminished in her hands: and Riccio may well
have confirmed her in this, as his own importance depended thereon:
Darnley ascribed the opposition he met with from his wife not so much to
her own decision as to the low-born foreigner against whom he now
conceived a violent hatred. His father, Lennox, who cared little for the
restoration of Catholicism in itself, entirely agreed with him as to
this. They held it allowable to put out of the way the intruder who
dared to hinder their house from mounting to the highest honours, and
who by the confidential intimacy in which he stood with the Queen gave
rise to all kinds of offensive rumours. With this object they&mdash;for the
instigation came from them&mdash;joined in a union with the Protestant
nobles. These regarded Riccio as their most thoroughgoing opponent: they
too wished him to be got rid of; but his death alone could not content
them. A Parliament was to meet at once, from which they expected nothing
but a complete condemnation of their former friends, and absolutely
ruinous resolutions against themselves. They made the overthrow of this
system a condition of their taking a share in getting rid of Riccio. The
King consented that Murray should be again placed at the head of the
government, in return for which the matrimonial crown was promised him.</p>

<p>On the 7th March the Queen went to the old council-house of Edinburgh to
make the necessary arrangements for the Parliament. The insignia of the
realm, sword crown and sceptre, were borne before her by the Catholic
lords, Huntley, Athol, and Crawford, the heads of those houses which had
once already, in France, offered her their alliance. The King had
refused to take part in the ceremony. She named the Lords of Articles,
who from of old exercised a decisive influence in the Scotch
Parliaments, and restored the bishops
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
to their place among them. As the
Queen declares, her object was to promote the restoration of the old
religion and to have the rebels sentenced by the assembled Estates. In
Holyrood, besides Huntley and Athol, Bothwell, Fleming, Levingstoun, and
James Balfour had also found favour, all men who had taken an active
part for the restoration of Catholicism or for the re-establishment of
the power of the crown: how much it must have surprised men to find that
the Queen granted Huntley and Bothwell, who had been declared traitors,
admittance into the Privy Council. If the Parliament adopted resolutions
in accordance with these preliminaries, it was to be expected that the
work of political and religious reaction would begin at once, with the
active participation not only of the Pope from whom some money had
already come, but also of other Catholic powers with whom Riccio kept
the Queen in communication.</p>

<p>A serious danger assuredly for the lords and for Protestantism; there
was not a moment to lose if they wished to avert it; but the attempt to
do so assumed, through the wild habits of the time and the country, that
character of violence which has made it the romance of centuries. The
event had such far-reaching results that we too must devote a discussion
to it.</p>

<p>In the low, narrow, and gloomy rooms of Holyrood House there is a little
chamber to which the Queen retired when she would be alone: it was
connected by an inner staircase with the King's lodgings. Here Mary was
sitting at supper on Saturday the 9th March 1566, with her natural
sister the Countess of Argyle, her natural brother the Laird of Creich,
who commanded the guard at the palace, and some other members of her
household, among whom was also Riccio; when the King, who had been
expected somewhat earlier, appeared and seated himself familiarly by his
wife. But at the same moment other unexpected guests also entered. These
were Lord Ruthven, who had undertaken to execute the vengeance of King
and country on Riccio, and his companions; under his fur-fringed mantle
were seen weapons and armour: the Queen asked in affright what brought
him there at that unwonted hour. He did not leave her long in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
doubt. 'I see a man here,' said Ruthven, 'who takes a place that does not become
him; by a servant like this we in Scotland will not let ourselves be
ruled,'<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>
and so prepared to lay hands on him.</p>

<p>Riccio took refuge near her; the Queen declared that she would punish an
attack on him as high treason, but swords were bared before her eyes,
Riccio was wounded by a thrust over her shoulder, and dragged away: on
the floor and on the steps he received more than fifty wounds: the
King's own dagger was said to have been seen in the body of the murdered
man. This may be doubted, as his jealousy was by no means so real; yet
he said soon after that he was responsible for the honour of his wife.
In the turmoil he had only just stretched out his hand, to guard her
person from any accident. For the nobles, who though acting with the
utmost violence yet did not wish to risk their whole future, it was
enough that he was there: his presence would authorise their act and
give it impunity. When the murder was done Ruthven returned to the Queen
and declared to her that the influence she had given Riccio had been
unendurable to them, as had been also his counsels for the restoration
of the old religion, his enmities against the great men of the land, his
connexions with foreign princes; he announced to her plainly the return
of the banished lords, with whom the others would unite in an opposite
policy. For they had not merely aimed at Riccio: at the same time the
Lords Morton and Lindsay, who had collected a number of trustworthy men,
had advanced with them and beset the approaches to the palace-yard.
Their plan was to get into their hands all their enemies who had
gathered round the Queen. But while their attention was fastened on
Riccio's murder, most of the threatened persons succeeded in escaping.
All the rest who did not belong to the household, and were taken in the
palace, were removed without distinction: the Queen was treated like a
prisoner.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>
She still possessed a certain popularity, as being
hereditary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
sovereign: a movement arose in the city in her favour, but
this was counterbalanced by the antipathies of the Protestants, and a
declaration of the King sufficed to still it. The next day a
proclamation appeared in his name which directed the members of the
Parliament, who had already arrived, to depart again.</p>

<p>It was at any rate secured that a restoration of Catholicism or a legal
prosecution of the banished lords was not to be thought of; the original
plan however was not completely carried out. As it appears, the temper
of the country had not been so far prepared beforehand as to make it
possible to deprive the Queen of her power. And the spirited princess
did not let herself be so easily subdued. Above all she succeeded in
gaining over her husband again, to whom the predominance of the lords
was itself derogatory; he helped her to escape and accompanied her in
her flight. When they were once safe in a strong place, her partisans
gathered round her; she placed herself at the head of a force, small
though it was, and occupied the capital; the chief accomplices in the
attack of Holyrood, Morton and Ruthven, fled from the country. She did
not however revert to her old plans: she resumed her earlier connexions
instead, her half-brother Murray again obtained influence, the old
members of the Privy Council stood by his side, after some time Morton
was able to return. Foreigners found that Scotland was as quiet as
before.</p>

<p>But this apparent quiet concealed a discord destined to produce still
greater complications. The Queen had only learnt afterwards the share
which Darnley had taken in Riccio's murder: it was her husband who had
instigated this insult to her royal honour: how could she ever again
repose confidence in him? And he no longer found support in the lords
whom he had deserted at the moment of the crisis. He was very far now
from obtaining the matrimonial crown or even any real influence: he saw
himself excluded from affairs more than ever, and despised. When his son
was baptised at Stirling, the father could not appear, though he was in
the palace: he was afraid of being insulted in public. His condition
filled him with shame: he often thought of leaving the kingdom,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
and made preparations for doing so. But he was not able to state and prove
his grievances: he had to acknowledge before the assembled Privy Council
that he had no complaints worth mentioning.</p>

<p>The Queen on her side had sometimes let drop her wish to be rid of such
a husband. She could not however think seriously of having her marriage
with him dissolved, as this could only be done by declaring it null and
void, and by that step her son, of whom she had just been delivered, and
who was to inherit all her rights, would have been at the same time
declared illegitimate. She was told that means would be found to carry
the matter through without prejudice to her son. She warned her friends
not to undertake anything which, though meant to help her, might prepare
yet more trouble.</p>

<p>How men stood to each other is clear from the fact that on the one side
Darnley and his father linked themselves with the Catholic party&mdash;they
were said to have adopted a plan of seizing the government, in the
Queen's despite, in the name of her new-born son<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>&mdash;while on the
other side the rest of the barons pledged themselves not to recognise
him but only the Queen. A league was already concluded between some of
them, originating with Sir James Balfour (who had been marked out for
death by the halter in Holyrood), to rid the world by force of a tyrant
and enemy of the nobility, against whom men must secure their lives.</p>

<p>Thus all was in preparation for a fresh catastrophe; a new personal
relation of the Queen brought it to pass.</p>

<p>Among the nobles of Scotland James Hepburn, Earl of Bothwell, was
especially distinguished for a fine figure, for youthful strength,
intrepid manly courage, proved in a thousand adventures, and decided
character. Though professedly a Protestant, he had attached himself to
the Regent without wavering, and assured the Queen of his assistance
while she was still in France. Can we wonder if Mary, under the pressure
of the party combinations around, needing before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
all things a friend personally devoted to her, sought for support in this tried and
energetic man? As she in general prized nothing more highly than bold
and valiant deeds, she had often told him how much she admired him; but
yet more than this,&mdash;we cannot doubt that she let herself be drawn into
a passionate connexion with him. Who does not know the sonnets and the
love-intoxicated letters she is believed to have addressed to him? I
would not say that every word of the latter is genuine; through the
several translations&mdash;from the French original (which is lost) into the
Scotch idiom, from this into Latin, and then back into French as we now
have them&mdash;they may have suffered much alteration: we have no right to
lay stress on every expression, and interpret it by the light of later
events: but in the main they are without doubt genuine: they contain
circumstances which no one else could then know and which have since
been proved to be true; no human being could have invented
them.<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>
It does not seem as if Mary's fondness for Bothwell was returned by him in
the same degree: in her letters and poems she is constantly combating a
rival, to whom his heart seems to give the preference. This was
Bothwell's own wife whom he had only shortly before married: she stayed
with him for a time in the neighbourhood of the court, but he took care
that the Queen knew nothing of her being there. As he was before all
things ambitious and desirous of power, he only cared for the Queen's
love and the possession of her person so far as it would enable him to
share her authority and to obtain the supreme power in Scotland. But for
this another thing was necessary; the King must be removed out of the
way. As Darnley had once joined Riccio's political enemies in the
Holyrood assassination, so Bothwell now united himself with Darnley's
enemies with a view to his murder, for which they were already quite
prepared. Morton was asked to join the enterprise this time also: but he
demanded a declaration from the Queen that she was not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
against it: and this Bothwell could not obtain.</p>

<p>But, it may be said, was not the Queen in collusion with him? Did she
not purposely bring back her husband, who had fallen sick at Glasgow, to
Edinburgh, and did she not lodge him in a lonely house there not far
from the palace under the pretence that the purer air would contribute
to his recovery, but in fact to deliver him over all the more surely to
destruction? Such has been always the general belief: even her
partisans, the zealous Catholics, at that time inclined to believe that
the Queen at least connived in the
plot.<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a>
But there was yet another view taken at the time, according to which the better relations that had
begun between husband and wife were not due to hypocrisy but were
genuine, and a complete reconciliation and reunion was to have been
expected: the returning inclination towards her husband was contending
in the Queen with her passion for Bothwell; and he was driven on, by the
apprehension that his prey and the prize of his ambition would escape
him, to hasten the execution of his
scheme.<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>
And psychologically the
event might be best explained in this way. But the statement has not
sufficiently good evidence for it to be maintained historically. A poet
might, I think, so apprehend it: for it is one of the advantages of
poetic representation, that it can take up even a slightly supported
tradition, and following it can infer the depths of the heart, those
abysmal depths in which the storms of passion rage, and those actions
are begotten which laugh laws and morality to scorn, and yet are deeply
rooted in the souls of men. The informations on which our historical
representation must be based do not reach so far: on a scrupulous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
examination they do not allow us to attain a definite conviction as to
the degree of complicity. Only there can be no doubt as to the fact that
this time too ambition and the lust of power played a great part. If
Bothwell once said he would prevent Darnley from setting his foot on the
necks of the Scotch, he thereby only expressed the feeling of the other
nobles. Yet he executed his murderous plot without their joining in it
and by means of his own
servants.<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a>
In the house before mentioned he
caused a quantity of gunpowder to be laid under the chamber in which
Darnley slept, in order to blow him into the air: alarmed at the noise
made by opening the door, the young sovereign sprang from his bed; while
trying to save himself, he was strangled together with the page who was
with him: the powder was then fired and the house laid in
ruins.<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a></p>

<p>So the dreadful deed was done: the news of it filled men at first with
that curiosity which always attaches to dark events that touch the
highest circles; they then busied themselves with the question as to who
would ascend the Scottish throne and give the Queen his hand,&mdash;among the
other suitors Leicester now thought the time come for him, and for
renewing good relations between England and Scotland:&mdash;but meanwhile to
every man's astonishment and horror a rumour spread that the Queen would
unite herself with the man to whom the murder of her husband was
ascribed. Men fell on their knees before her, to represent the dishonour
she would thus draw on herself, and even the danger into which she would
bring her child. Letters from England were shown her in which the ruin
of all her prospects as to the English throne was intimated, if she took
this step: for it would strengthen the suspicion, which had arisen on
the spot, that she had been an accomplice in her husband's murder. But
she was already no longer her own mistress. Bothwell now did altogether
what he would. He obtained from the lords, who feared him, a declaration
that he was guiltless of any share in the King's murder, and even their
consent to his marriage with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
the Queen. He said publicly he would marry
the Queen, whoever might be against it, whether she would or not. And if
Mary wished ever again to govern the country, and make the lords feel
her vengeance, Bothwell might appear to her the only man who could
assist her in this. Half of her free will, half by force, she fell into
his power and thus into the necessity of giving him her hand. An
archiepiscopal matrimonial court found in a near relationship between
Bothwell and his wife a pretext for dissolving his previous
marriage.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>
Bothwell was created Duke of Orkney: he began to exercise
the royal power for his own objects; his friends, even the accomplices
in the murder, were
promoted.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p>

<p>But how could it be expected that the Lords would tolerate in the much
more dangerous hands of Bothwell a power they would not have endured in
Darnley's? Against him they had the full support of the people; filled
with moral aversion to the Queen for the guilt she had incurred, or
which was attributed to her, they expressed their loyalty only in
hostility to her; a general uneasiness showed itself as to the safety of
her son who was likewise threatened by his father's murderers.</p>

<p>Under a banner on which were depicted the murdered King and his child
the latter praying for help, a great army marched against the castle
where the newly-married pair dwelt. Bothwell merely regarded the hostile
lords as his rivals, who envied him the great position to which he had
raised himself, and thought to rout them all with the feudal array which
gathered round him at the Queen's summons. But at the decisive moment
the feeling of the country infected his own people as well; instead of
being able to fight he had to fly. He was forced to live as a pirate in
the Northern Seas; for he could no longer remain in the country. The
Queen fell into the power of the Lords, who placed her in the strong
castle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
which the Douglas had built in the middle of Loch Leven, and
detained her as a prisoner.</p>

<p>In France it was not wholly forgotten that she had once been the Queen
of that realm; a fiery champion of the Catholics boasted that, if they
would give him a couple of thousand arquebusiers, he would free her from
custody in despite of the Scots; but Catharine Medici, who besides was
no friend of hers, rejected this absolutely, as they had already so many
irons in the fire.<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>
On the other hand Elizabeth concerned herself
for the interests of her endangered neighbour with a certain emphasis.
But the Scots were already discontented with the conduct of England, and
complained loudly that since the treaty of Leith nothing good had come
to them from thence;<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a>
they were resolved to pay their neighbour no
more attention, but to manage their own affairs for themselves.</p>

<p>Their path was clearly marked out for them. They had murdered Riccio,
conspired against Darnley, driven Bothwell away, and all for the special
reason that they had tried to create a strong supreme power over them:
they could not possibly allow the Queen, irritated and insulted as she
was, to again obtain the exercise of her power. Mary therefore was
forced to resign the Scotch crown in favour of her son, and to name her
brother Murray regent during his minority. Immediately on this the
ceremony of anointing and crowning the child was performed in an almost
grotesque manner.<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a>
Two superintendents and a bishop set the crown on
his head, which the Lords there present touched in token of their
consent; two of them, Morton and Hume, then swore in the name of the new
King, James VI, that he would uphold the religion now prevailing in
Scotland, and combat all its enemies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span></p><p>When after this Murray, who had exiled himself to France, and had taken
no share in the last catastrophe (which he foresaw), returned, he was in
a position once more to conduct the government according to his old
policy, only with greater independence. A Parliament was called which
now for the first time confirmed the statutes made in 1560 in favour of
the Kirk, and also came to such an arrangement about the confiscated
church-property as made it possible for it to exist.</p>

<p>So ruinous for Mary were the results of her attempt to break through the
combination which formed the condition of her government in Scotland,
and to effect a restoration of the old ecclesiastical and political
forms. Before the power which she wished to overthrow her own had gone
down.</p>

<p>But she was not yet minded to submit to it. And mainly through a
personal relation which she had entered into with the young George
Douglas, who conceived hopes of her hand, she succeeded in escaping out
of her prison and over the lake, bold and venturous as she always was.
In the country there were many who thought themselves to stand so high
above the bastard Earl of Murray, that they held it a disgrace to obey
him: all these gathered round her; and as she then, the very day after
her escape, revoked her abdication, they bound themselves together to
replace her on the throne. In the league, at the head of which stood the
Hamiltons, we find eight bishops and twelve abbots,&mdash;for the
re-establishment of the Catholic Church was part of the plan: a
considerable army was brought into the field with this object. Murray
and his party were however the stronger of the two, they represented the
organised power of the State, and their soldiers were the best
disciplined. The Queen, who, at Langsyde, from a neighbouring eminence,
looked on at the battle between the two armies, had to witness her own
men being scattered without having done the enemy any damage,&mdash;Murray is
said to have lost only one man. He himself put a stop to the slaughter
of the fugitives. Still even now her affairs did not seem to those
around her utterly lost, for all her friends had not yet appeared in the
field, and there were still strong places to which she could retreat.
But she aimed not merely at defence, but at overpowering her enemies. As
what she had just seen left her no hope of this in Sco<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>tland, she
adopted the idea of demanding help from the Queen of England. For the
latter had in the strongest terms made known to the Scotch barons her
displeasure at the treatment of their Queen, which was not in harmony
with the laws of God or man, and had threatened to punish them for the
wound thus inflicted on the royal dignity. She had once sent Mary
herself a jewel as a pledge of her friendship. Mary was warned by those
around her not to put full trust in these assurances. But she was quite
accustomed to take her resolutions under passionate emotion, and could
not then be dissuaded from her views. Through forests and woods, over
stock and stone, without a single woman attendant, without any other
food than the Scotch oatcake, day and night she kept on her way to the
coast, from which she betook herself in a small boat to Carlisle. Her
soul was thirsting to subdue the rebels: her firm trust was to draw
Queen Elizabeth into the war against them: she came, not to seek a
refuge, but to gain troops and assistance. </p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class='centersm'><a name="BIII_IV" id="BIII_IV"></a>
INTERDEPENDENCE OF THE EUROPEAN DISSENSIONS IN POLITICS AND RELIGION.</p>

<p>If we inquire into the reason why Philip II gave up his previous
relations with England and sided with the Queen of Scots, we shall find
it mainly in the fact that the victory of Protestant ideas in England
exercised a counter-action which was insupportable for the government he
had established in the Netherlands. But that he gave Mary no help in her
troubles, though information was once collected as to how it might be
done, may also be traceable to the disturbances that had broken out in
the Netherlands, the suppression of which occupied all his attention and
resources.</p>

<p>In 1568 the Duke of Alva was master of the Netherlands: he was already
able to send a considerable force to help the French government, which
had once more broken an agreement forced upon it by the Huguenots; the
stress of the religious war was transferred to France, and there too the
Catholic military force by degrees gained the upper hand.</p>

<p>It was under these circumstances that Mary Stuart appeared in England
with a demand for help. If in the Netherlands the attempts of the nobles
and the Protestant tendencies had been alike defeated, they had on the
other hand, by a similar union, achieved a decisive victory in Scotland.
Was Elizabeth to join Mary in combating them?</p>

<p>Elizabeth disliked the proceedings of the Scotch nobles towards their
lawful Queen; the adherents of the Scotch church-system were already
troublesome to her in England: but, however much she found to blame in
them, in the great contest of the world they were her allies. Mary on
the other hand held to that great system of life and thought with which
the English Queen and her ministers had broken. Whatever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
Elizabeth might have previously promised, she did not mean to be bound by it under
circumstances so completely
altered.<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>
Had she chosen to restore
Mary, she would have opened the island to all the influences which she
desired to exclude. Nor did she wish to let her retire to France, for
while Mary had resided there previously, England had not had a single
quiet day: without doubt the Catholic zeal prevailing there would have
been at once excited in support of her claims to the English throne. An
attempt was again made to reconcile the Scotch nobles with their Queen:
but as this led to an enquiry respecting her share in the guilt of the
King's murder&mdash;those letters of Mary to Bothwell now first came to the
knowledge of the public&mdash;the dissension became rather greater and quite
irreconcilable.</p>

<p>One now begins to feel sympathy with the Queen of Scots, especially as
her share in the crime imputed to her is not quite clear. Of her own
free will she had come to England to seek for assistance on which she
thought she could reckon: but high considerations of policy not merely
prevented its being given but also made it seem prudent to detain her in
England.<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>
Elizabeth and her ministers brought themselves to prefer
the interests of the crown to what was in itself right and fit. Mary did
not however on this account vanish from the stage of the world: rather
she obtained an exceedingly important position by her presence in
England, where one party acknowledged her immediate claim to the throne,
the other at least her claim to the succession; and hence arose not
merely inconveniences but very serious dangers for the English
government. Even in 1569, at a moment when the Catholic military power
had the superiority in France and the Netherlands, Mary's uncle, the
Cardinal of Lorraine, proposed to the King of Spain an offensive
alliance against Queen Elizabeth.<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a>
In the civil wars of France they had just
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
won the victory in two great battles. Who could say what the
result would have been if in the still very unprepared condition of
England an invasion had been undertaken by the combined Catholic powers?</p>

<p>But the life and the destiny of Europe depend on the fact that the great
general antagonisms are perpetually crossed by the special ones of the
several states. Philip did not wish for an alliance with the French; it
seemed to him untrustworthy, too extensive and, even if it led to
victory, dangerous. He declared with the greatest distinctness, that he
thought of nothing but of putting down his rebels (including at the time
the Moriscoes), and the complete pacification of the Netherlands; he
would not hear of a declaration of war against England. The difficulty
of this sovereign's position on all sides and his natural temperament
were the determining element in the history of the second half of the
sixteenth century. His great object, the re-establishment and extension
of the Catholic religion, he never leaves out of sight for a moment; but
yet he pursues it only in combination with his own special interests. He
is accustomed to weigh all the chances, to proceed slowly, to pause when
the situation becomes critical, to avoid dangerous enterprises. Open war
is not to his taste, he loves secret influences.</p>

<p>In November 1569 a rebellion broke out in England, not without the
connivance of the Spanish ambassador, but mainly under the impression
made by the Catholic victories in France, as to which Mary Stuart also
had let it be known that they rejoiced her inmost soul. It was mainly
the Northern counties that rose, as had before been the case in 1536 and
1549. Where the revolt gained the upper hand, the Common Prayer-book and
sometimes the English translation of the Bible as well were burnt, and
the mass re-established. Many nobles, above all in the North itself,
still held Catholic opinions. At the head of the present insurrection
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
stood the Percies of Northumberland, the Nevilles of Westmoreland, the
Cliffords of Cumberland; Richard Norton, who rose for the Nevilles,
venerable for his grey hair, and surrounded by a troop of sons in their
prime, carried the Cross as a banner in front of his men. The nobility
did not exactly want to overthrow the Queen, but it wished to force her
to alter her government, to dismiss her present ministers, and above all
to recognise Mary Stuart's claim to the succession&mdash;which would have
given her an exceedingly numerous body of supporters in England and thus
have seriously hampered the Queen. But now the government possessed a
still more decided ascendancy than even in 1549. It had come upon the
traces of the enterprise in time to quell it at its first outbreak, and
had at once removed the Queen of Scots out of reach of the movement. The
commander in the North, Thomas Ratcliffe, Earl of Sussex, one of the
Queen's heroes, who bore himself bravely and blamelessly in other
spheres of action as well as in this, and has left behind him one of the
purest of names, encountered the rebels with a considerable force,
composed entirely of his own men; these the rebels were the less able to
withstand, as they knew that still more troops were on the march. As the
ballad of a northern minstrel says, the gold-horned bull of the
Nevilles, the silver crescent of the Percies, vanished from the field:
the chiefs themselves fled over the Scotch border, their troops
dispersed, their declared partisans underwent the severest punishments.
Many who knew themselves guilty passed over to the Queen's party in
order to escape.</p>

<p>But at the very time of this victory the war against the Queen at home
and abroad first received its most vivid impulse through the supreme
head of the Catholic faith. Pope Pius V, who saw in Elizabeth the
protectress of all the enemies of Catholicism, had issued the long
prepared and hitherto withheld excommunication against her. In the name
of Him who had raised him to the supreme throne of Right, he declared
Elizabeth to have forfeited the realm of which she claimed to be Queen:
he not merely released her subjects from the oath they had taken to her:
'we likewise forbid,' he added, 'her barons and peoples henceforth to
obey this woman's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
commands and laws, under pain of
excommunication.'<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a>
It was a proclamation of war in the style of
Innocent III: rebellion was therein almost treated as a proof of faith.</p>

<p>The way in which the Queen opened her Parliament in 1571 forms as it
were a conscious contrast to the Papal bull, and its declaration that
she was deposed. She appeared in the robes of state, the golden coronal
on her head. At her right sat the dignitaries of the English Church, at
her left the lay lords, on the woolsack in the centre the members of the
Privy Council, by the sides stood the knights and burgesses of the lower
house. The keeper of the great seal reminded the Houses of the late
years of peace, in which&mdash;a thing without example in England&mdash;no blood
had been shed; but now peace seemed likely to perish through the
machinations of Rome. All were of one accord that they must confront
this attempt with the full force of the law. It was declared high
treason to designate the Queen as heretical or schismatic, to deny her
right to the throne, or to ascribe such a right to any one else. To
proselytise to Catholicism, or to bring into England sacred objects
consecrated by the Pope, or absolutions from him, was forbidden and
treated as an offence against the State. What a decidedly antipapal
character did the Church, which retained most of the hierarchic usages,
nevertheless assume! The oath of supremacy became indispensable even for
places at court and in the country districts, in which it had not
hitherto been required. Men deemed the Queen's ecclesiastical power the
palladium of the realm.</p>

<p>In this form the war of religion appeared in England. The Protestant
exiles from the Netherlands and France sought and found a refuge here in
large bodies; it has been calculated that they then composed
one-twentieth of the inhabitants of London, and they were settled in
many other places. But the fiery passions, which on the Continent led to
the re-establishment of Catholicism, reacted on the old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
English families of the Catholic faith as well, and produced, under the
influence of Spanish or Italian agitators, ever new attempts at
overthrowing the government.</p>

<p>It was just then, there cannot be any doubt of it, that Thomas duke of
Norfolk, who might be regarded as almost the chief noble of the realm,
became concerned in such an attempt. Somewhat earlier the idea had been
entertained that his marriage with Mary Stuart might contribute to
restore general quiet in both kingdoms: but Queen Elizabeth had
abandoned this plan, and he had pledged himself to her under his hand
and seal not to enter into any negociation about it without her previous
knowledge. Nevertheless he had allowed himself to be drawn by an Italian
money-changer, Roberto Ridolfi, who had lived long in England, not
merely into a new agreement with this object in view but into
treasonable designs. Norfolk possessed an immense following among the
nobility of both religious parties: and, as he would not declare himself
a Catholic at once, he thought to have the Protestant lords also on his
side, if he married Mary Stuart, whom many of them regarded as the
lawful heiress of the realm. He applied for the Pope's approval of his
proceedings, and promised to come forward without reserve if a Spanish
force landed in England: he affirmed that his views were not directed to
his own advancement, but only to the purpose of uniting the island under
one sovereign, and re-establishing the old laws and the Catholic
religion. These thoughts hardly originated with the duke, they were
suggested to him by Ridolfi, who himself drew up the instructions with
which Norfolk and Mary despatched him to the Pope and the King of
Spain.<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a>
Ridolfi had been sent to Mary with full powers from the
Pope, and also well provided with money. When he now appeared again in
Rome with his instructions, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
really contained simply the
acceptance of his proposals, he was, as may be imagined, received with
joy: the Pope, who expected the salvation of the world from these
enterprises, recommended them to King Philip. In Spain also they met
with a good reception. We are astonished at the naiveté with which the
Council of State proceeded to deliberate on the proposal of a sudden
stroke by which an Italian partisan undertook to seize the Queen and her
councillors at one of her country-houses. The King at last left the
decision to the Duke of Alva. Alva would have been in favour of the plan
itself, but he took into consideration that an unsuccessful attempt
would provoke a general attack from all sides on the Netherlands, which
were only just subdued and still full of ferment. He thought the King
should not declare himself until the conspirators had succeeded in
getting the Queen into their hands, alive or dead. If Norfolk made his
rising contingent on the landing of a Spanish force in England, Alva on
the other hand required that he should already have got the Queen into
his power before his own master made his participation in the scheme
known.<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p>

<p>But while letters and messages were being exchanged in this way (for
Ridolfi held it necessary to be in communication with his friends in
England and Scotland), Elizabeth's watchful ministers had already
discovered all. Even before Ridolfi reached Spain, Elizabeth gave the
French ambassador an intimation of the commission with which the Queen
of Scots had entrusted
him.<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a>
The latter had not yet received any
kind of answer from Spain when the Earl of Shrewsbury, in whose custody
she then was at Sheffield, reproached her with the schemes in which she
was implicated, and announced to her a closer restriction of her liberty
as a punishment for them: further Elizabeth would not at that time as
yet proceed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
against her. In Spain and Italy they were still expecting
the Duke of Norfolk to take up arms, when he was already a prisoner.
Elizabeth struggled long against giving him over to the arm of the law,
but her friends held an execution absolutely necessary for her personal
security. On the scaffold in the Tower Norfolk said he was the first to
die on that spot under Queen Elizabeth and trusted he would be the last.
All people said Amen.</p>

<p>The scheme of this revolt proceeded more from Italy and Rome than from
Spain: King Philip had taken no active part in it, the Duke of Alva had
rather set himself against it: but we need only glance at their
correspondence to perceive how completely nevertheless they were
implicated in the matter. To carry on the war against Elizabeth not in
his own name but in the name, and for the restoration of the rights, of
the Queen of Scotland, would have exactly suited the policy of Philip
II: he thought such an opportunity would never present itself again;
they must avail themselves of it and finish the affair as quickly as
possible, that France might not take part in it. If Alva counts up the
difficulties which manifestly stood in the way of the scheme, yet he
promises to execute the King's wishes with all the means in his power,
with person and property: 'God will still send the King other favourable
opportunities as a reward for his religious
zeal.'<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></p>

<p>Queen Elizabeth expelled the Spanish ambassador, Gueran de Espes, who
had undeniably taken part in Ridolfi's schemes as well as in the last
rising, from England; as soon as he reached Brussels, the English and
Scotch fugitives gathered round him, and communicated to him many new
schemes of invasion, to which his ear was more open than that of the
Duke of Alva. An attack was to be tried, now on Scotland, now on
Ireland, now on England itself.</p>

<p>We cannot suppose that in England they knew every word that was uttered
about these plans, or that everything
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
they did believe there was well
grounded. But from year to year men's minds were more and more filled
with the idea that Philip II was the great enemy of their religion and
of their country. In the sphere of classical literature the translation
of Demosthenes in 1570 is noteworthy in this respect. What Demosthenes
says against Philip of Macedon, in regard to the Athenians, the
translator finds applicable to Philip II; he calls the English to open
war in the words of the ancient orator, 'for as it was then, so is it
now, and ever will be.'</p>

<p>But for this Elizabeth on her side did not feel inclined or prepared.
Many acts of hostility took place at sea in a piratical war, in politics
they stood sharply opposed to each other: but they were not inclined on
either side for an open contest, front to front.</p>

<p>Above all the English held it necessary now to come to a good
understanding with the other of the two great neighbouring powers. It
stood them in good stead that a tendency to moderate measures gained
sway in France; the English ambassadors took a very vivid interest in
the project of a marriage between Henry of Navarre and Margaret of
Valois. While the victory of Lepanto filled the hearts of the partisans
of Spain with fresh hopes, the jealousy it awakened in the French
contributed largely to their withdrawal from Spain and the Pope, and
their readiness for an alliance with England. The two powers promised
each other mutual support against any attack, on whatever ground it
might at any time be undertaken. A later explanation of the treaty
expressly confirmed its including the case of
religion.<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></p>

<p>Thus secured on this side the Queen proceeded to carry out an idea which
had immense consequences. It is not a mere suspicion, partially derived
from the result, to suppose that she thought King Philip's combining
with her rebels gave her a right to combine with the King's revolted
subjects: she herself said so once to the French ambassador: while
talking with him, she one day dropped her voice, and said that as Philip
kept her state disturbed, she did not hold herself any longer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
bound to treat him with the regard she had hitherto shewn him in the quarrels of
the Netherlands.</p>

<p>It is not quite true that she supported with her own power the Gueux
('Beggars'), who had fled to the sea from Alva's persecutions, in the
decisive attacks they now made on Brielle and Vliessingen (Brill and
Flushing): but this was hardly needed, it was quite enough that her
feeling was known, she merely let things take their way, she did not
prevent the attack of the rebels against Philip II (powerful at sea as
they were) being supported by the fugitive Walloons residing in England,
and by Englishmen also. It was estimated that there were then in
Vliessingen 400 Walloons and 400 English: 1500 English lay before the
town, to keep off the attacks of the Spaniards. French troops gave aid
in corresponding numbers. They were all recalled at a later time; but
meanwhile the insurrection had gained a consistency which made it
impossible for the Spaniards to subdue the Netherlands.</p>

<p>As formerly Elizabeth had joined the Scotch lords against the Regent and
the Queen of Scotland, so now she helped the insurgents of the
Netherlands against the King of Spain. In the first case she had Philip
II himself on her side, in the second case France.</p>

<p>By this policy she found the means of securing herself at home, from the
Spanish attacks. It was more than ever necessary for Philip to
concentrate on the war in the Netherlands all the forces of which he
could dispose. The Queen did not yet take direct part in it, and Philip
had to avoid everything that could induce her to do so. It was not her
object to bring about the independence of the Provinces: but she
insisted on the departure of the Spanish troops, the observance of the
provincial constitutions, and above all assured liberty for the
Protestant faith. In 1575 she offered the King her mediation, not
however without including one special English matter, namely the
mitigation of the severe religious laws in reference to English
merchants in the Spanish countries: the King took the opinion of the
Grand Inquisitor on it. As if he could ever have been in its favour
himself! The Pacification of Ghent in 1576 was quite in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
accordance with the Queen's views, since it established the supremacy of the Estates,
and freedom of religion for the chief Northern provinces. To maintain
this, she had no hesitation in concluding an alliance with the States,
and in consequence despatching a body of English troops to the
Netherlands. She informed the King himself of this, and requested him to
recall the Stadtholder Don John, his half-brother (who was trying to
break the peace), and to receive the Estates into his favour: she did
not by this think to come to a breach with him.</p>

<p>The idea of entrusting Don John of Austria, the victor of Lepanto, with
the restoration of Catholicism in West Europe had been at that time
adopted in Rome. His was a fiery nature pervaded by Catholic principles,
and seized with the most vivid ambition to be something in the world and
to effect something. The Irish wished him to be their king; he was to
free Mary Stuart from prison, vindicate her rights alike in Scotland and
in England, and at her side ascend the throne of the British kingdoms
now united in Catholicism. Mary gladly acceded to this, as she had
already long wished for a marriage with the Spanish house. It was
probably to give this combination a firmer basis that she proposed, in
case her son did not prove to be a Catholic, to transfer her claims on
the throne of England to the King of Spain, or to any of his relatives
whom he should name in conjunction with the
Pope.<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a>
But whom could she mean by these last words but Don John himself, who then stood in
close connexion with the Guises, whom she also recommended most
pressingly to the King. But she had at the same time directed her aim
towards Scotland. There her enemies Murray and Lennox had perished by
assassination; under the following regents, Mar and Morton, Mary had
still nevertheless so many partisans, that they never could have
ventured, as they were requested to do from England, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
allow Mary to come to Scotland and be put on her trial: their own power would have
been endangered by it. Mary too believed herself to have prepared
everything there so well for an enterprise by Don John that, as she
says, an overthrow of the Scotch government would infallibly have ensued
if Philip II had only put his hand to the work. And how closely were his
interests bound up with it! Without a conquest of the island-kingdom, as
his brother represented to him, the Netherlands could never be subdued.
But even now he shunned an open rupture. Besides this his brother's
restlessness and thirst for action, and his political intrigues which
were already reacting on Spain, were disagreeable to him; he could not
make up his mind to take a decisive step.</p>

<p>He had again and again been vainly entreated to interest himself in the
population of Ireland, in which national and religious antagonism
contended against the supremacy of England. One of the confidential
agents secretly sent thither assured him that he was implored by
nine-tenths of the inhabitants to take them under his protection and
save their souls, that is restore them the mass, which they could no
longer celebrate publicly: they appealed to their primeval relationship
with the Iberian people, to ancient prophecies which looked forward to
this, and to the great political interests at stake. Philip was not
disinclined to attempt the enterprise; but he required the co-operation
of France, without doubt to break the opposition of this power in the
affairs of the Netherlands; a condition which could not be made
acceptable to the French by any interposition of Rome.</p>

<p>And so, if Pope Gregory XIII wished to undertake anything against
Ireland, he had to do it himself. Men witnessed the singular spectacle
of an expedition against Ireland being fitted out on the coasts of the
States of the Church. A papal general from Bologna came to the
assistance of the powerful Irish chief, Fitzmaurice. They commanded the
Irish districts far and wide, and made inroads into the English: for a
long time they were very troublesome, although not really dangerous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
King Philip was then busied in an undertaking which interested him still
more closely than even that of the Netherlands: he made good his
hereditary claim to Portugal, without being obstructed in it either by
the opposition of a native claimant or by the counter-working of the
European powers.</p>

<p>In the face of this success, by which the Spanish monarchy became master
of the whole Pyrenean peninsula and its many colonies in East and West,
it was all the more necessary for the other two powers to hold together.
Many causes of quarrel indeed arose between them. How could the shocking
event of the night of St. Bartholomew fail to awaken all the antipathies
of the English, and indeed of Protestantism in general! Elizabeth did
not let herself be prevented by her treaty from supporting the French
Protestants in the manner she liked, that is without its being possible
to prove it against her. Under Charles IX she contributed to prevent
them from succumbing, under Henry III she helped them in recovering a
certain political position: for this very object the Palsgrave Casimir
led into France German troops paid with English money. Catharine Medici
often reproached her with observing a policy like that of Louis XI. But
the common interest of the two kingdoms was always more powerful than
these differences; frequent and long negociations were carried on for
even a closer union. The marriage of Queen Elizabeth with Catharine's
youngest son was once held to be as good as certain: he actually
appeared personally in England. We refrain from following the course of
these negociations. The interest they awaken constantly ends in
disappointment, for they are always moving towards their object without
attaining it. But perhaps it will repay our trouble to consider the
reasons which came into consideration for and against the proposed
connexion.</p>

<p>The main reason for it was that England must hinder an alliance between
Spain and France, especially one in favour of the Queen of Scots. And
certainly nothing had stood the English policy in Scotland in such stead
as the good understanding with France. But much more seemed attainable
if France and England were united for ever. They would then be able to
compel the King of Spain to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
conclude a peace with the Netherlands which
would secure them their liberties; and, if he did not observe it, they
would have grounds for a common occupation of a part of the Provinces.
If there should be any issue of the marriage, this would put an end to
all attacks on Elizabeth's life, and greatly strengthen the attachment
of her subjects.</p>

<p>But against it was the fact that this marriage would bring the Queen
into disagreeable personal relations; and the country would be as
unwilling to see a French king as it had once a Spanish one. And how
would it be, if a son sprung from the marriage, to inherit both the
French and the English throne? was England to be ruled by a viceroy?
What an opposition the world would raise to the union of these mighty
kingdoms, into what complications might it not lead! Scotland would
again attach itself to the French: the Netherlands and the German
princes would be alienated.</p>

<p>The members of the Privy Council, after they had weighed all these
considerations, at last pronounced themselves on the whole against it.
They recommended the continuance of the present system,&mdash;the support of
the Protestants, especially in France, a good understanding with the
King of Scotland, and the maintenance of religion and justice in
England: thus they would be a match for every threat of the King of
Spain.<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>

<p>But that sovereign had one ally against whom these precautions could not
suffice, the Order of Jesuits and the seminaries of English priests
under its guidance.</p>

<p>Young exiles from England, who were studying in the Universities of the
Netherlands, to prevent the Catholic priesthood from perishing among the
English at home, had been already in Alva's time brought together in a
college at Douay, which was then removed to Rheims as the revolt spread
in the Netherlands. Pope Gregory XIII was not content with supporting
this institution by a monthly subsidy; he was ambitious of imitating
Gregory the Great and exercising
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
a direct influence on England: he
founded in Rome itself a seminary for the reconversion of that country.
He made over for this purpose the old English hospital which was also
connected with the memory of Thomas Becket. The first students however
fell out with each other, and there was seen in Rome the old antagonism
of the 'Welsh' and the 'Saxons'; in the end the latter gained the upper
hand, it was mainly their doing that the institution was given over to
the Jesuits. Not long after its activity began. Each student on his
reception was bound to devote his powers to spreading the Catholic
doctrines in England; by April 1580 a company of thirteen priests was
ready, after receiving the Pope's blessing, to set out with this object.
The chief among them were Robert Parsons, who passed into England
disguised as a soldier, and Edmund Campion as a merchant. The first went
to Gloucester and Hereford, the other to Oxford and Northampton: they
and the friends who followed them found everywhere a rich
harvest.<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a>
It was arranged so that they arrived in the evening at the appointed
houses of their friends: there they heard confessions and gave advice to
the faithful. Early in the morning they preached, and then broke up
again; it was customary to provide them an armed escort to guard them
from any mischance.</p>

<p>Withal the forms of the church-service in England had been so arranged
that it might remain practicable for the Catholics also to take part in
it. How many had done so hitherto, perhaps with a rosary or a Catholic
book of prayers in their hands! The chief effort of the seminarist
priests, on their return to the country, was to put an end to this: they
dissuaded intercourse with the Protestants even on indifferent matters.
The Queen's statesmen were astonished to find how much the number of
recusants increased all at once; from secret presses proceeded writings
of an aggressive, and exceedingly malignant, character; in many places
Elizabeth was again designated as illegitimate, a usurper, no longer as
Queen. On this the repressive system, which had been already set in
motion in consequence of Pope Pius V's bull, was made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
more stringent; this is what has brought on the Queen's government the charge of
cruelty. The Catholics too began to compose their martyrologies. One of
the first priests whose execution they describe, Cuthbert Mayne, was
condemned by the jury for bringing the Bull with him into other people's
houses together with some <i>Agnus Dei.</i><a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a>
Young people were condemned
for trying to make their way to the foreign seminaries. On the wish of
the missionaries Pope Gregory XIII explained the bull so far, that the
excommunication pronounced in it against all who should obey the Queen's
commands was meant to be in suspense till it was possible to execute it
against the Queen herself on whom it continued to weigh<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a>. This
limitation however rather increased the danger. The Catholics could
remain quiet till rebellion was possible, then it became a duty. The
law-courts now sought above all to make the accused priests declare
themselves as to the validity of the bull and its obligation. Men held
themselves justified in extreme severity against those who 'slip into
the country at the instigation of the great enemy, the Pope, and poison
the hearts of the subjects with pernicious
doctrines.'<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a>
On this ground Campion met his death; Parsons escaped. Assuredly there were not
so many executed as the Catholic world wished to reckon, but yet
probably more than the statesmen of England admitted. They persisted
that it was not a persecution for religion: and in fact the controverted
questions lay mainly in the region of the conflict between Papacy and
Monarchy: those executed were not so much martyrs of Catholicism as of
the idea of the Papal supremacy over monarchs. But how closely connected
are these ideas with each other! The priests for their part believed
that they were dying for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
God and the Church. But the effect which the
English government had in view was, with all its severity, not produced.
We are assured on Catholic authority that in 1585 there were yet several
hundred priests actively engaged. From their reports it is clear that
they were still always counting on a complete victory. They vigorously
pressed for the attempt at an invasion, which they represented as almost
sure of success; 'for two-thirds of the English are still Catholic; the
Queen has neither strong places nor disciplined troops: with 16,000 men
she might be overthrown.' This time also the house of the Spanish
ambassador, Bernardino Mendoza, formed the meeting-point for these
tendencies; he kept up a constant communication with the emigrants who
had been declared rebels, and with the discontented at home, with Mary
Stuart and her friends in Scotland, with the zealous Catholics
throughout the world, especially with the Guises, with whom Philip II
himself now had an understanding. The increasing power of his sovereign
gained him also an ever-increasing consideration.</p>

<p>It was in these days that the Western and Southern Netherlands were
again subdued by King Philip. After the death of his brother, his nephew
Alexander Farnese of Parma had formed an army of unmixed Catholic
composition, which had naturally from its inner unity gained the upper
hand over the government of the States, which had called now a German
and now a French prince to its head, and was composed of different
religions and nationalities. First the seaports, then the towns of
Flanders, and at last the wealthy Antwerp also, which by its mental
activity and commercial resources had materially nourished the revolt,
fell into the hands of the Spaniards. The Prince of Orange was
assassinated by a fanatic. Alexander of Parma, who ascribed his
victories to the Virgin Mary, pushed on his conquests gradually till
they reached the Northern and Eastern Provinces.</p>

<p>The reaction of these events, even while they were still in progress,
was first felt in Scotland. There the young King James VI after many
vicissitudes had, while still under age, taken the reins of government
into his own hands: and a son of his great uncle, Esmé Stuart (who
exchanged the title Aubigny which he brought from France for the more
famous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
name of Lennox, and was a great friend of the Guises and the
Jesuits) obtained the chief credit with him. Lennox promoted
Catholicism, which was not so difficult, as part of the nobility still
adhered to it, at least in secret; he too lived and moved in
comprehensive plans for the re-establishment of the Church. Through the
Guises he hoped to be placed in a position to invade England with a
Catholic army of 15,000 men; if the English Catholics then did their
duty, everything they wanted could be attained: for himself he was
resolved to liberate Mary or die in the attempt. Mary was also to
reascend the Scotch throne: her son was to be co-regent with her,
provided that he himself returned to the bosom of the Catholic Church.
Mary Stuart with her indestructible energy was involved in these designs
also. She commended them warmly to the Pope and the King of Spain: for
it was precisely in Scotland that the universal re-establishment could
best be begun.<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a>
She wished only to know on what resources in men and
money her friends there might reckon. We must remember the situation and
the peril of these schemes and preparations, if we would understand to
some degree the violent measures on which the Protestant lords in
Scotland resolved. As in a similar case of an earlier time in Germany,
they closed the castle, in which King James was received, against his
attendants: Lennox had to leave Scotland. But the young King was shrewd
enough, and sufficiently well advised, to rid himself of the lords
almost in the same way that they had taken him. He succeeded, chiefly
through the help of the French ambassador, a friend of the Guises.
Hereupon too he seemed much inclined to favour the undertaking with
which Henry Guise occupied himself in 1583, a scheme for a revolution in
the affairs of both countries. Guise hoped, with the support of the King
of Spain, the Pope, and the Duke of Bavaria, to be able to effect
something decisive. James VI let his uncle know his full agreement with
the proposed schemes. But, in fact, it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
did not seem to matter much
whether he agreed or not. It was reported to Queen Mary, that the
Catholic party in Scotland reckoned on having the most powerful king of
Christendom on their side, with or against James' will; that Philip II
was building so many vessels that in a short time he would become
completely master of the Western ocean, and be able to invade whatever
countries he pleased.</p>

<p>It is evident how dangerous for England these Scotch movements were in
themselves: Queen Elizabeth thought herself most vulnerable on the side
of Scotland: moreover she already saw herself directly threatened. A
plan fell into her hands, in which the number of ships and men necessary
for an invasion of England, the harbours where they were to land, the
places they were to seize, even the men on whose help they could reckon,
were enumerated.<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a>
She convinced herself that the plan came from
Mendoza, who held out the prospect of his King's assistance for the
purpose, as the attack was to be made simultaneously from the
Netherlands and from Spain. This time too Elizabeth dismissed the
hostile ambassador; but how could she flatter herself with having thus
exorcised the threatening elements? Now that the foe, with whom she had
been for fifteen years at war&mdash;though not an open war yet one of which
both sides were conscious&mdash;had become very much stronger, she was forced
to take up a decisive position against him, to save herself from being
overpowered.</p>

<p>In 1584 her chief minister, William Cecil, now Lord Burleigh, High
Treasurer of the kingdom, drew her attention to this necessity. He
represented to her that she had nothing to fear from any one in the
world except from Spain&mdash;but from Spain everything. King Philip had
gained more victories from his cabinet, than his father in all his
campaigns: he ruled a nation which was thoroughly of one mind in
religion, ambitious, brave, and resolute; he had a most devoted party
among the discontented in England. The question
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
for the Queen was,
whether she hoped to tame the lion or whether she wished to bind him.
She could not build on treaties, for the enemy would not keep them. And,
if he was allowed to subdue the Netherlands completely, no one in the
world could avoid seeing to what object his power would be directed. He
advises the Queen not to let things go so far&mdash;for those countries were
the counterscarp of England's fortress&mdash;but to proceed to open war, to
withstand the Spaniards in the Netherlands and attack them in the
Indies. 'Better now,' he exclaims, 'while the enemy has only one hand
free, than later when he can strike with
both.'<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></p>

<p>In August 1585 Antwerp fell into the hands of the Spaniards; in the
capitulation the case is already taken into consideration, that Holland
and Zealand also might submit. The Northern Netherlands were threatened
from yet another side, as Zutphen and Nimuegen had just been taken by
the Spaniards. In this extreme distress of her natural ally she delayed
no longer. The sovereignty they offered her she refused anew, but she
engaged to give considerable assistance, in return for which, as a
security for her advances, the fortresses Vliessingen and Briel were
given up into her possession. To prove how much she was in earnest in
this, she entrusted the conduct of the war in the Netherlands to Dudley,
Earl of Leicester, who was still accounted her favourite and was one of
the chief confidants of her policy. In December 1585 Leicester reached
Vliessingen; on the 1st of January 1586, Francis Drake appeared before
St. Domingo and occupied it. The war had broken out by land and by sea.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class='centersm'><a name="BIII_V" id="BIII_V"></a>
THE FATE OF MARY STUART.</p>

<p>How completely the circumstances of these times are misunderstood, when
they are measured by the rules of an age of peace! Rather they were
filled with hostilities in which politics and religion were mingled;
foreign war was at the same time a domestic one. The religious
confessions were at the same time political programmes.</p>

<p>The Queen took up arms not to make conquests, but to secure her very
existence against a daily growing power that openly threatened her,
before it had become completely an overmatch for her: she provoked an
open war: but she had not done enough when she now, as is necessary in
such cases, took into consideration the training of soldiers, securing
the harbours, fortifying strong places, improving the navy: the most
pressing anxiety arose from the general Catholic agitation in the
country.</p>

<p>Elizabeth's statesmen were well aware that the sharp prosecution of the
seminarist priests was not enough to put an end to it. With reference to
the laity, the Lord Treasurer, however strict in other respects,
recommends to his sovereign quite a different mode of proceeding. We
should never proceed to capital punishment of such men: we should rather
mitigate the oath imposed on them: in particular we should never force
the nobles to a final decision between their religious inclinations and
their political duties, never drive them to despair. But at the same
time he gives a warning against awakening any hope in them that their
demands could ever be satisfied, for this would only make them more
obstinate. And on no consideration should arms be put into their hands.
'We do not wish to kill them, we cannot coerce them, but we dare
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span> not
trust them.' Nothing would be more dangerous than to assume a confidence
which was not really felt.</p>

<p>Even before this the Privy Council had recommended the Queen to employ
Protestants only in the government of her State, and to exclude all
Catholics from a share in
it.<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a>
The before-mentioned 'Advice' of Lord
Burleigh is remarkable for extending the Protestant interest and adding
a popular one to it. He thinks it intolerable that the copyholders and
tenants of the Catholic lords, even when they fulfil their obligations
in all other respects, experience bad treatment from them on account of
religion: it is impossible to let many thousand true subjects be
dependent on such as have hostile intentions. The plan Henry VIII had
once entertained, of diminishing the authority of the Lords, is now
brought by the High Treasurer at this crisis once more into vivid
recollection. The Queen is to bind the Commons to herself, to win over
their hearts. And Burleigh advises allowing the followers of dissenting
Protestant Churches, especially the Puritans, to worship as they please:
in preaching and catechising they are more zealous than the
Episcopalians, very far more successful in converting the people, and
indispensable for weakening the popish party. We see how the necessity
of the war acts on home affairs. The chief minister favoured the
elements which were forcing their way out through the existing forms of
the state.</p>

<p>In this general strain on men's minds their eyes once more turned to the
Queen of Scots in her captivity. What would there have been at all to
fear at other times from a princess under strong custody and cut off
from all the world? But in the excitement of that age she could even so
be still an object of apprehension. Her personal friends had from the
first not seen a great mischance in her enforced residence in England.
For by blameless conduct she refuted the evil report which had followed
her thither from Scotland; and her right as heiress of the crown came to
the knowledge of the whole
nation.<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a>.
In the days at which we have arrived we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
know with certainty that her presence in the country formed
a great lever for Catholic agitation. A report found in the papal
archives has been published, by which it is clear how much support men
promised themselves from her for every resolute
undertaking.<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a>
This document says that since she has numberless partisans, and although in
prison has uninterrupted communication with them, she will always find
means, when the time comes, of giving them notice of the approaching
opportunity: she is resolved to encounter every hardship, nay even death
itself, for the great
cause.<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></p>

<p>Occupied with measures of defence on all sides, the English government
had already long been considering how to meet this danger. This was the
very reason why Elizabeth's marriage was so often spoken of with popular
approbation: if she had children, Mary's claims would lose their
importance. Gradually however every man had to confess to himself that
this was not to be expected, and on other grounds hardly to be wished.
Then men thought how to solve the difficulty in another way.</p>

<p>The chief danger was this: if an attempt on Elizabeth's life succeeded,
the supreme authority would devolve on Mary, who was on the spot, who
cherished entirely opposite views, and would have at once realised
them:&mdash;the thought occurred as early as 1579 of declaring by formal act
of parliament that all persons by whom the reigning Queen should be in
any way endangered or injured should forfeit any claim they might have
to the crown;<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>
terms which though general were in reality directed
only against the Queen of Scots; at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
that time the proposal was not carried into effect.</p>

<p>The negociations are not yet completely cleared up which were carried on
with Mary in 1582-3 for her restoration in Scotland. The English once
more repeated their old demand, that Mary should even now ratify the
treaty of Edinburgh, and annul all that had been done in violation of it
by her first husband or by herself. She was further not merely to
renounce every design against the security and peace of England, but to
pledge herself to oppose it: and in general, as long as Elizabeth was
alive, to put forward no claim to the English throne: whether she had
such a right after Elizabeth's death the parliament of England was to
decide.<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a>
Here too the old view came into the foreground: Parliament
was to be made the judge of hereditary right. The negociation failed
owing to the Scotch intrigues of these years, in which the intention
rather was to assert the claim of inheritance with the strong hand.</p>

<p>And from day to day new attempts on Elizabeth's life came to light. In
1584 Francis Throckmorton, who took part in these very schemes, was
executed: in 1585 Parry also, who confessed having been in connexion
with Mary's plenipotentiary in France, and who had come over to
assassinate Queen Elizabeth. Writings were spread abroad in which those
about her were called on to imitate, against this female Holofernes, the
example set in the book of Judith.</p>

<p>Protestant England in the danger of its sovereign saw its own. In all
churches prayers were offered for her safety. The most remarkable proof
of this temper is contained in an association of individuals for
defending the Queen, which was at that time subscribed to far and wide
through the country. It begins with a statement that, to promote certain
claims on the crown, the Queen's life was threatened in a highly
treasonable manner, and enters into a union in God's name, in which each
man pledges himself to the others, to combat with word and deed, and
even to pursue with arms, all who should make any attempt on the Queen's
person; and not to rest till
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
these wretches were completely destroyed.
If the attempt was so far successful as to raise a claim to the crown,
they pledged themselves never to recognise such a claim: whoever broke
this oath and separated himself from the association should be treated
by the other members as a
perjurer.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></p>

<p>The main object of this association was to cut off all prospect of the
succession from any attempt in favour of the Queen of Scots: a great
part of the nation pledged itself to reject a claim made good in this
manner as exceptionable in every respect. The Parliament of 1585, many
of whose members belonged to the association, not merely confirmed it
formally: it now also expressly enacted, that persons in whose favour a
rebellion should be attempted, and an attack on the Queen undertaken,
should lose their right to the crown: if they themselves took part in
any such plots, they were to forfeit their life. The Queen was empowered
to appoint a commission of at least twenty-four members to judge of this
offence.</p>

<p>These resolutions and unions were of a compass extending far beyond the
present occasion, however weighty. How important the ecclesiastical
contest had become in all questions concerning the supreme temporal
power! That the deposition of Queen Elizabeth, pronounced by the Pope,
had no effect was due to the Protestant tendencies of the country, and
to the fact that her hereditary claim had been hitherto unassailed. But
now it was a similar hereditary claim, made by Queen Mary, not, it is
true, formally recognised, but also not rejected, on which the partisans
of this princess based their chief hope. Mary herself, who always
combined the most vivid dynastic feelings with her religious
inclinations, in her letters and statements does not lay such stress on
anything as on the unconditional validity of her claim to inherit the
throne. When for instance her son rejected the joint government which
she proposed to him, she remarked with striking acuteness that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
this involved an infringement of the maxims of hereditary right; since he
rejected her authorisation to share in the government, and recognised as
legitimate the refusal of obedience she had experienced from her
rebellious subjects. Once she read in a pamphlet that people denied
Queen Elizabeth the power to name a successor who was not of the
Protestant faith: she wrote to her that the supreme power was of divine
right, and raised high above all these considerations, and warned her
against opinions of that kind which were avowed by some near her, and
which might lead to the elective principle and become dangerous to
herself. This could not fail to have an exactly opposite effect on
Elizabeth. She was again threatened through the strict dynastic right
that she also enjoyed: she needed some other additional support. Despite
all inclination to the contrary, she decided to look for it in the
Parliament. She likewise aimed at making Mary submit the validity of her
claim to its previous decision. She could not but be thankful that her
subjects pledged themselves not to recognise any right to the succession
which was to be asserted by an attack on her life; she ratified the act
by which Parliament gave these feelings a legal form. It is obvious how
powerfully the rights of Parliament were thus advanced as against the
absolute claim of the hereditary monarchy. In the course of the
development of events this was to be the case in a still higher degree.</p>

<p>Mary rejected with horror the suspicion that she could take part in an
attempt on Elizabeth's life: she wished to enrol herself in the
Association for her
security.<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a>
And who could have failed to believe
at least that the threats against her own right and life, in case of a
second attempt at assassination, would deter her partisans as well as
herself from any thought of it! For they well understood the energy with
which the Parliament knew how to vindicate its laws.</p>

<p>But it is vain to try to bridle men's passions by showing them their
results. If the attempt on the Queen's life succeeded,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>cceeded
this Parliament of course would be annihilated as well as the Queen herself, and another
order of things begin.</p>

<p>In the seminary at Rheims the priests persuaded an English emigrant,
called Savage, who had served in the army of the Prince of Parma, that
he could not better secure himself eternal happiness than by ridding the
world of the enemy of religion who was excommunicated by the holy
father. Another English emigrant, Thomas Babington, a young man of
education and ambition, in whom throbbed the pulse of chivalrous
devotion to Mary, was informed of this design by a priest of the
seminary, and was fired with a kind of emulation which has something
highly fantastic about it. Thinking that so great an enterprise ought
not to be confided to one man, he sought and found new confederates for
it; when the murder was effected, and the Spanish troops landed, he was
to be the man who with a hundred sturdy comrades would free his Catholic
Queen from prison and lead her to her throne. Mendoza at that time (and
indeed by Mary's recommendation, as she tells us) was Spanish ambassador
in France: he was in communication with Babington and strengthened him
in his purpose. Of all the distinguished men of the age Mendoza is
perhaps the one who took up most heartily the idea of uniting the French
and Spanish interests, and advocated it most fervently. King Philip II
was also informed of the design. He now, as he had done fifteen years
before, declared his intention, if it succeeded, of making the invasion
simultaneously from Spain and Flanders. The Queen's murder, the rising
of the Catholics, and at the same moment a twofold invasion with trained
troops would have certainly been enough to produce a complete
revolution. The League was still victorious in France: Henry III would
have been forced to join it: the tendencies of the strictest Catholicism
would have gained a complete triumph.</p>

<p>If we enquire whether Mary Stuart knew of these schemes, and had a full
understanding with the conspirators, there can be no doubt at all of it.
She was in correspondence with Babington, whom she designates as her
greatest friend. The letter is still extant in which she strengthens him
in his purpose of calling forth a rising of the Catholics in the different
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
counties, and that an armed one, with reasons for it true and
false, and tells him how he may liberate herself. She reckons on a fine
army of horse and foot being able to assemble, and making itself master
of some harbours in which to receive the help expected not merely from
Flanders and Spain, but also from France. In the letter we even come
upon one passage which betrays a knowledge of the plot against
Elizabeth's life; there is not a word against it, rather an approbation
of it, though an indirect
one.<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a></p>

<p>And we have yet another proof of her temper and views at this time lying
before us. As the zeal of the Catholics for her claim to the succession
might be weakened by the fact that her son in Scotland, on whom it
naturally devolved, after all the hopes cherished on his behalf, still
remained Protestant, she reverted to an idea that had once before passed
through her mind: she pledged herself to bring matters in Scotland to
such a point that her son should be seized and delivered into the hands
of the King of Spain: he was then to be instructed in the Catholic faith
and embrace it; if James had not done so at the time of her death, her
claim on England was to pass to Philip II. Day and night, so she said,
she bewailed her son's being so stiffnecked in his false faith: she saw
that his succession in England would be the ruin of the country.</p>

<p>So it stands written in her letters: it is undeniable: but was that
really her last and well-considered word? Was it her real wish that
Elizabeth should be killed, her son disinherited notwithstanding her
dynastic feelings, and that Philip II should become King of England?
Were the Catholic-Spanish tendencies of Elizabeth's predecessor, Queen
Mary Tudor, so completely reproduced in her?</p>

<p>I think we can hardly maintain this with full historic certainty. Mary
Stuart was not altogether animated by hot religious zeal: if she had
been, how could she formerly have left the Protestant lords in
possession of power so long as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
she did, and even have once thought of
marrying Leicester with his Protestant views? Her son affirmed that he
possessed letters from her, in which she approved of his religious views
and confirmed him in them. It was not religious conviction and the
abhorrence of any other faith, as in Mary Tudor, but her dynastic right
and her self-confidence as sovereign that were the active and
predominant motives in all the actions of Mary Stuart. And if there are
contradictions in her utterances, we cannot hold her capable, like
Catharine Medici, of taking up and secretly furthering two opposite
plans at the same time; her different tendencies appear consecutively,
not simultaneously, in exact accordance with her impulses. For Mary
Stuart was never quiet an instant: even in her prison she shared in the
movement of the world; her brain never ceased working; she was brooding
over her circumstances, her distress and her hope, how to escape the one
and realise the other: sometimes indeed there came a moment of
resignation, but only soon to pass away again. She throws all her
thoughts into her letters which, even if they are aiming at some object
close at hand, are at the same time ebullitions of the moment,
passionate effusions, productions of the imagination rather than of the
understanding. Who could think such a letter possible as that in which
she once sought to inform Elizabeth of the evil reports about her which
the Countess of Shrewsbury made, and recounted a mass of scandalous
anecdotes she had heard from her. The communication was meant to ruin
the countess: Mary did not remark that it must also draw down the
Queen's hatred on herself. No one would have dared even to lay the
letter before the Queen. Mary's was a passionate nature, endowed with
literary gifts: she let her pen run on without saying anything she did
not really think at the instant, but without remembering in the least
what lay beyond her momentary mood. Who will hold women of this
character strictly to what stands in their letters? These are often as
inconsiderate and contradictory as their words.</p>

<p>While Mary was writing the above-mentioned letters, she was completely
taken up with the proposals made to her. She guarded herself from
inserting anything that could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
hinder their being carried into effect:
by the eventual transfer of her son's claims to the foreign King, all
opposition on the part of zealous Catholics would be done away. Her
hopes and wishes hurried her away with them, so that she lost sight of
the danger in which she thus placed herself. And was she not a Queen,
raised above the law? Who would take it on himself to attack her?</p>

<p>Mary Stuart was then under the charge of a strict Puritan, Sir Amyas
Paulet, of whom she complained that he treated her as a criminal
prisoner and not as a queen. The government now allowed a certain
relaxation in the external circumstances of her custody, but not in the
strictness of the superintendence. There hardly exists another instance
of such a striking contrast between projects and facts. Mary composes
these letters full of far-ranging and dangerous schemes in the deepest
secrecy, as she thinks, and has them carefully re-written in cipher: she
has no doubt that they reach her friends safely by a secret way: but
arrangements are made so that every word she writes is laid before the
man whose business it is to trace out conspiracies, Walsingham, the
Secretary of State. He knows her ciphers, he even sees the letters that
come for her before she does: while she reads them with haste and in
hope of better fortune at hand, he is only waiting for her answer to use
it against her as a decisive proof of her guilt.</p>

<p>Walsingham now found himself in possession of all the threads of the
conspiracy; as soon as that letter to Babington was in his hands, he
delayed no longer to arrest the guilty persons: they confessed, were
condemned and executed. By further odious means&mdash;the prisoner being
removed from her apartments on some pretence and the rooms then
searched&mdash;possession was obtained of other papers which witnessed
against her. Then the question could be laid before the Privy Council
whether she should now be brought to trial and sentenced in due form.</p>

<p>Who had given the English Parliament any right to make laws which should
be binding on a foreign queen, and in virtue of which, if she
transgressed them, she could be punished with death? In fact these
doubts were raised at the
time.<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a>
Against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
them it was alleged that
Mary, who had been forced to abdicate by her subjects and deprived of
her dignity, could not be regarded any longer as a queen: while a
deposed sovereign is bound by the laws of the land in which he resides.
If she was still a queen, yet she was subject to the feudal supremacy of
England, and because of her claim to its crown also subject to its
sovereignty&mdash;two arguments that contradict each other, one of a feudal,
the other of a popular character and closely connected with the idea of
popular sovereignty. Whether the one or the other convinced any person,
we do not hear; it was moreover not a matter for argument any longer.</p>

<p>For how could anything else be expected but that the judicial
proceedings prepared several years before would now be put in force? A
law had been passed calculated for this case, if it should occur. The
case had occurred, and was proved by legal evidence. It was necessary
for the satisfaction of the country and Parliament&mdash;and Walsingham laid
particular stress on this&mdash;that the matter should be examined with full
publicity.</p>

<p>The commission provided for in the Act of Parliament was named: it
consisted of the chief statesmen and lawyers of the country. In
Fotheringhay, whither the prisoner had now been brought, the splendid
ancestral seat of the princes of the house of York, at which many of
them were buried, they met together in the Hall on the 14th October.
Mary let herself be induced to plead by the consideration that she would
be held guilty, if she did not make any defence: it being understood
that it was with the reserve that she did not by this give up any of the
rights of a free sovereign. Most of the charges against her she
gradually admitted to be true, but she denied having consented to a
personal attempt on Elizabeth's life. The court decided that this made
no essential difference. For the rebellion which Mary confessed to
having favoured could not be conceived of apart from danger to the Queen
of England's life as well as her
government.<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a>
The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
court pronounced that Mary was guilty of the acts for which the punishment of death had
been enacted in the Parliamentary statute.</p>

<p>We cannot regard this as a regular criminal procedure, for judicial
forms were but little observed; it was the decision of a commission that
the case had occurred in which the statute passed by Parliament found
its application. Parliament itself, then just summoned, had the
proceedings of the Commission laid before it and approved their
sentence.</p>

<p>But this did not bring the affair to an end. Queen Elizabeth deferred
the execution of the judgment. For in relation to such a matter she
occupied quite a different position from that of Parliament.</p>

<p>From more than one quarter she was reminded that, by carrying out the
sentence, she would violate the divine right of kings; since this
implied that subjects could not judge, or lay their hands on,
sovereigns. How unnatural if a queen like herself should set her hand to
degrade the diadem.<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></p>

<p>In the Privy Council some were of opinion that, as Mary could not be
regarded as the author of the last plot, but only as privy to it, closer
imprisonment would be a sufficient punishment for her. Elizabeth caught
at this idea. The Parliament, she thought, might now formally annul
Mary's claim to the English throne, declare it to be high treason to
maintain it any longer, and high treason also to attempt to liberate her
from prison: this would deter her partisans from an attempt then become
hopeless, and also satisfy foreign
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
nations. But it was urged in reply,
that now to repudiate Mary Stuart's claim for the first time would be
equivalent to recognising its original validity; and an English law
would make no impression either on Mary or on her partisans. The
remembrance of what had happened in Scotland revived again; of Darnley's
murder, which men imputed to her without hesitation: she was compared to
Johanna I of Naples who had taken part in her husband's murder: it was
said, Mary has doubled her old guilt by attempts against the sacred
person of the Queen; after she had been forgiven, she has relapsed into
the same crime, she deserves death on many
grounds.<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></p>

<p>Spenser, in the great poem which has made him immortal, has depicted the
conflict of accusations and excuses which this cause called forth. One
of his allegorical figures, Zeal, accuses the fair and splendid lady,
then on her trial, of the design of hurling the Queen from her throne,
and of inciting noble knights to join in this purpose. The Kingdom's
Care, Authority, Religion, Justice, take part with him. On the other
side Pity, Regard for her high descent and her family, even <i>Grief</i>
herself, raise their voices, and produce a contrary impression. But Zeal
once more renews his accusation: he brings forward Adultery and Murder,
Impiety and Sedition, against her. The Queen sitting upon the throne in
judgment recognises the guilt of the accused, but shrinks from
pronouncing the word: men see tears in her eyes; she covers her face
with her purple robe.</p>

<p>Spenser appears here, as he usually does, an enthusiastic admirer of his
Queen. But neither should we see hypocrisy in Elizabeth's scruples,
which sprang much more from motives which touched her very nearly. She
kept away from all company: she was heard to break her solitary
meditation by uttering old proverbs that applied to the present case.
More than once she spoke with the deputation of Parliament which pressed
for a decision. What she mainly represented to them was, how hard it was
for her, after she had pardoned so many rebellions, and passed over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
so much treason in silence, to let a princess be punished, who was her
nearest blood-relation: men would accuse her, the Virgin Queen, of
cruelty: she prayed them to supply her with another means, another
expedient: nothing under the sun would be more welcome to her. The
Parliament firmly insisted that there was no other expedient; it argued
in detailed representations that the deliverance of the country depended
on the execution of the sentence. The Queen's own security, the
preservation of religion and of the state, made it absolutely necessary.
Mary's life was the hope of all the discontented, whose plots were
directed only to the object of enabling her to ascend the throne of
England, to destroy the followers of the true religion, and expel the
nobility of the land&mdash;that is the Protestant nobility. And must not
satisfaction be given to the Association which was pledged to pursue a
new attempt against the Queen's life even to death? 'Not to punish the
enemy would be cruel to your faithful subjects: to spare her means ruin
to us.'</p>

<p>Meanwhile they came upon the traces of a new attempt. In presence of the
elder French ambassador, Aubespine, a partisan of the Guises, mention
was made of the necessity of killing Elizabeth in order to save Mary at
the last moment. One of his officers spoke with a person who was known
in the palace, and who undertook to pile up a mass of gunpowder under
Elizabeth's chamber sufficient to blow it into the air; he was led to
hope for rewards from Guise and his brother Mayenne, whose interests
would have been greatly promoted by such a
deed.<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a>
But this time too
Elizabeth was made acquainted with the design before it came to
maturity. She ascribed her new danger to the silence, if not to the
instigation, of the ambassador, the friend of the Guises: in its
discovery she saw the hand of God. 'I nourish,' she exclaims, 'the viper
that poisons me;&mdash;to save her they would have taken my life: am I to
offer myself as a prey to every
villain?'<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
At a moment when she was especially struck with the danger which threatened her from the very
existence of her rival, after a conversation with the Lord Admiral, she
had the long-prepared order for the execution brought to her, and signed
it with quick and resolute strokes of the pen.</p>

<p>The observation of Parliament, that her safety and the peace of the
country required her enemy's death, at last gained the upper hand with
her as well. But this did not imply that her conflicting feelings were
completely silenced. She was haunted in her dreams by the idea of the
execution. She had once more recourse to the thought that some
serviceable hand might spare her the last authorisation, by secretly
executing the sentence of the judges&mdash;an act which seemed to be
justified even by the words of the Association; the demand was made in
due form to the Keeper of the prisoner, Sir Amyas Paulet; he rejected
it&mdash;and how could anything else have been expected from the
conscientious Puritan&mdash;with an expression of his astonishment and
indignation. Elizabeth had commissioned Secretary Davison, when she
signed the order, to have it sealed with the Great Seal. Her idea seems
to have been that, when all the forms had been duly complied with, she
might the more easily get a secret execution, or that at some critical
moment it might be at once performed; but she still meant to keep the
matter in her own hand: for the custom was, before the last step, to
once more ask her approval. But Davison, who marked her hesitation, did
not think it advisable at this moment. Through Hatton he acquainted Lord
Burleigh with the matter, and Burleigh put the question to the other
members of the Privy Council: they took it on themselves to despatch the
order, signed and sealed as it now was, without further delay to
Fotheringhay.<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a></p>

<p>On the 8th of February 1587 it was executed on Mary in the very hall
where the sittings of the court had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
been held. As compared with
Elizabeth's painful disquiet, who shrank from doing what she held to be
necessary, and when she at last did it wished it again undone and
thought she could still recall it, the composure and quiet of soul, with
which Mary submitted to the fate now finally decided, impresses us very
deeply The misfortune of her life was her claim to the English crown.
This led her into a political labyrinth, and into those entanglements
which were connected with her disastrous marriage, and then, through its
combination with the religious idea, into all the guilt which is imputed
to her more or less justly. It cost Mary her country and her life. Even
on the scaffold she reminded men of her high rank which was not subject
to the laws: she thought the sentence of heretics on her, a free queen,
would be of service to the kingdom of God. She died in the royal and
religious ideas in which she had lived.</p>

<p>It is undeniable that Elizabeth was taken by surprise at this news: she
was heard sobbing as though a heavy misfortune had befallen herself. It
may be that her grief was lightened by a secret satisfaction: who would
absolutely deny it? But Davison had to atone for taking the power into
his own hands by a long imprisonment: the indispensable Burleigh hardly
obtained pardon. In the city on the other hand bells were rung and
bonfires kindled. For the universal popular conviction agreed with the
judgment of the court, that Mary had tried to deliver the kingdom into
the hands of Spaniards. </p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p class='centersm'><a name="BIII_VI" id="BIII_VI"></a>
THE INVINCIBLE ARMADA.</p>

<p>At this moment the war with the Spaniards&mdash;the resistance which the
English auxiliaries offered to them in the Netherlands, as well as the
attack now being made on their coasts&mdash;occupied men's minds all the
more, as the success of both the one and the other was very doubtful,
and a most dangerous counter-stroke was to be expected. The lion they
wished to bind had only become exasperated. The naval war in particular
provoked the extreme of peril.</p>

<p>Hostilities had been going on a long while, arising at first from the
privateering which filled the whole of the Western Ocean. The English
traders held it to be their right to avenge every injustice done them on
their neighbours' coasts&mdash;for man has, they said, a natural desire of
procuring himself satisfaction&mdash;and so turned themselves into
freebooters. Through the counter operations of the Spaniards this
private naval war became more and more extensive, and then also
gradually developed more glorious impulses, as we see in Francis Drake,
who at first only took part in the mere privateering of injured traders,
and afterwards rose to the idea of a maritime rivalry between the
nations. It was an important moment in the history of the world when
Drake on the isthmus of Panama first caught sight of the Pacific, and
prayed God for His grace that he might sail over this sea some day in an
English ship&mdash;a grace since granted not merely to himself but also in
the richest measure to his nation. Many companies were formed to resume
the voyages of discovery already once begun and then again discontinued.
And as the Spaniards based their exclusive right to the possession of
the other hemisphere on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span> Pope's decision, Protestant ideas, which
mocked at this supremacy of the Romish See over the world, now
contributed also to impel men to occupy lands in these regions. This was
always effected in the main by voluntary efforts of wealthy mercantile
houses, or enterprising members of the court and state, to whom the
Queen gave patents of authorisation. In this way Walter Ralegh, in his
political and religious opposition to the Spaniards, founded an English
colony on the transatlantic continent, in Wingandacoa: the Queen was so
much pleased at it that she gave the district a name which was to
preserve the remembrance of the quality she was perhaps proudest of: she
called it Virginia.<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></p>

<p>But at last she formally undertook the naval war; it was at the same
time a motive for the league with the Hollanders, who could do excellent
service in it: by attacking the West Indies she hoped to destroy the
basis of the Spanish greatness.</p>

<p>Francis Drake was commissioned to open the war. When, in October 1585,
he reached the Islas de Bayona on the Gallician coast, he informed the
governor, Don Pedro Bermudez, that he came in his Queen's name to put an
end to the grievances which the English had had to suffer from the
Spaniards. Don Pedro answered, he knew nothing of any such grievances:
but, if Drake wished to begin war, he was ready to meet him.</p>

<p>Francis Drake then directed his course at once to the West Indies. He
surprised St. Domingo and Carthagena, occupied both one and the other
for a short time, and levied heavy contributions on them. Then he
brought back to England the colonists from Virginia, who were not yet
able to hold their own against the natives. The next year he inflicted
still more damage on the Spaniards. He made his way into the harbour of
Cadiz, which was full of vessels that had either come from both the
Indies or were proceeding thither: he sank or burnt them all. His
privateers covered the sea.</p>

<p>Often already had the Spaniards planned an invasion of England. The most
pressing motive of all lay in these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
maritime enterprises. The Spaniards
remarked that the stability and power of their monarchy did not rest so
much on the strong places they possessed in all parts of the world as on
the moveable instruments of dominion by which the connexion with them
was kept up; the interruption of the communication, caused by Francis
Drake and his privateers, between just the most important points on the
Spanish and the Netherlandish coasts, seemed to them unendurable: they
desired to rid themselves of it at any price. And to this was now added
the general cry of vengeance for the execution of the Queen of Scots,
which was heard from the pulpit in the presence of the King himself. But
this was not the only result of that event. The life of Queen Mary and
her claim to the succession had always stood in the way of Spanish
ambition: now Philip II could think of taking possession of the English
throne himself. He concluded a treaty with Pope Sixtus V, under which he
was to hold the crown of England as a fief of the Holy See, which would
thus, and by the re-establishment of the Church's authority, have also
attained to the revival of its old feudal supremacy over
England.<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a></p>

<p>Once more the Spanish monarchy and the Papacy were closely united in
their spiritual and political claims. Sixtus V excommunicated the Queen
afresh, declared her deposed, and not merely released her subjects from
their oath of allegiance, but called on every man to aid the King of
Spain and his general the Duke of Parma against her.</p>

<p>Negociations for peace however were still being carried on in 1587
between Spanish and English plenipotentiaries. It was mainly the
merchants of London and Antwerp that urged it; and as the Spaniards at
that time had manifestly the best of the struggle, were masters of the
lower Rhine and the Meuse, had invaded Friesland, had besieged and at
last taken Sluys in despite of all resistance, we can understand how the
English plenipotentiaries were moved to unexpected concessions. They
would have consented to the restoration of the Spanish supremacy over
the northern Netherlands,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
if Philip would have granted the inhabitants
freedom of conscience. Alexander of Parma brought forward a proposal, to
make, it is true, their return to Catholicism obligatory, but with the
assurance that no Inquisition should be set over them, nor any one
punished for his deviation from the faith. Even if the negociation was
not meant to be completely in earnest, it is worth remarking on what
rock it was wrecked. Philip II would neither grant such an assurance,
which in its essence involved freedom of conscience, nor grant this
itself completely in a better form. His strength lay precisely in his
maintaining the Catholic system with unrelenting energy: by this he
secured the attachment of the priests and the zealous laity. And how
could he, at a moment when he was so closely united with the Pope, and
could reckon on the millions heaped up in the castle of St. Angelo for
his enterprise, so completely deviate from the strictness of exclusive
belief. He thought he was within his right when he refused any religious
concession, seeing that every other sovereign issued laws prescribing
the religion of his own
territories.<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a></p>

<p>If the war was to be continued, Alexander of Parma would have wished
that all his efforts should be first directed against Vliessingen, where
there was an English garrison; from the harbour there England itself
could be attacked far more easily and safely. But it was replied in
Spain that this enterprise was likewise very extensive and costly, while
it would bring about no decisive result. And yet Alexander himself too
held an invasion of England to be absolutely necessary; his reports
largely contributed to strengthen the King in this idea; Philip decided
to proceed without further delay to the enterprise that was needful at
the moment and opened world-wide prospects for the future.</p>

<p>He took into consideration that the monarchy at this moment had nothing
to fear from the Ottomans who were fully occupied with a Persian war,
and above all that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
France was prevented from interfering by the civil
strife that had broken out. This has been designated as the chief aim of
Philip's alliance with the Guises, and it certainly may have formed one
reason for it. Left alone, with only herself to rely on (so the
Spaniards further judged), the Queen of England would no longer be an
object of fear: she had no more than forty ships; once in an engagement
off the Azores, in the Portuguese war, the English had been seen to give
way for the first time: if it came to a sea-fight, the vastly superior
Spanish Armada would without doubt prove victorious. But for a war on
land also she was not prepared, she had no more than six thousand real
soldiers in the country, with whom she could neither meet nor resist the
veteran troops of Spain in the open field. They had only to march
straight on London; seldom was a great city, which had remained long
free from attack, able to hold out against a sudden assault: the Queen
would either be forced to make a peace honourable to Spain, or would by
a long resistance give the King an opportunity of forming out of the
Spanish nobility, which would otherwise degenerate in indolence at home,
a young troop of brave warriors. He would have the Catholics for him and
with their help gain the upper hand, he would make himself master of the
strong places, above all of the harbours; all the nations of the world
could not take them from him again; he would become lord of the ocean,
and thus lord and master of the
continent.<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a></p>

<p>Philip II would have preferred to begin the work as early as the autumn
of 1587. He hoped at that time that Scotland, where the Catholic lords
and the people showed a lively sympathy with Queen Mary's fate, would be
thrown open to him by her son, who was supposed to wish to avenge her
death. But to others this seemed not so certain; in especial the
experienced Admiral Santa Cruz called the King's attention to the perils
the fleet might incur in those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
seas: they would have to contend with
contrary winds, and the disadvantage of short days and thick mists.
Santa Cruz did not wish to endanger his fame, the only thing he had
earned during a long life, by an ill-timed or very venturous
undertaking. He held an invasion of England to be more difficult than
most other enterprises, and demanded such preparations as would make the
victory certain. While they were being made he died, after having lost
his sovereign's favour. His successor, the duke of Medina Sidonia, whom
the King chose because he had distinguished himself at the last defence
of Cadiz, did not make such very extensive demands; but the fleet, which
was fitted out under him and by him, was nevertheless, though not in
number of ships (about 130), yet in tonnage, size, and number of men on
board (about 22,000) the most important that had ever been sent to sea
by any European power. All the provinces of the Pyrenean peninsula had
emulously contributed to it: the fleet was divided into a corresponding
number of squadrons; the first was the Portuguese, then followed the
squadrons of Castille, Andalusia, Biscay, Guipuzcoa, and then the
Italian&mdash;for ships and men had come also in good number from Italy. The
troops were divided like the squadrons; there was a 'Mass in time of
war' for each province.</p>

<p>With not less zeal did men arm in the Netherlands; the drum beat
everywhere in the Flemish and Walloon provinces, all roads were covered
with military trains. In the Netherlands too there were a great number
of Italians, Corsicans and inhabitants of the States of the Church and
Neapolitans, in splendid accoutrements; there were the brothers of the
grand duke of Tuscany and of the duke of Savoy: King Philip had even
allowed the son of a Moorish prince to take part in the Catholic
expedition. Infantry and cavalry also had come from Catholic Germany.</p>

<p>It was a joint enterprise of the Spanish monarchy and a great part of
the Catholic world, headed by the Pope and the King, to overthrow the
Queen who was regarded as the Head, and the State which was regarded as
the main support, of Protestantism and the anti-Spanish policy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
We do not find any detailed and at the same time authentic information
as to the plan of the invasion; a Spanish soldier and diplomatist
however, much employed in the military and political affairs of the
time, and favoured with the confidence of the highest persons, J.
Baptista de Tassis, gives us an outline, which we may accept as quite
trustworthy. We know that in Antwerp, Nieuport, and Dunkirk, with the
advice of Hanseatic and Genoese master-builders, transports had been got
ready for the whole force: from Nieuport (to which place also were
brought the vessels built at Antwerp) 14,000 men were to be conveyed
across to England, and from Dunkirk 12,000. But where were they to
effect a junction with each other and with the Spaniards? Tassis assures
us that they had selected for this purpose the roadstead of Margate on
the coast of Kent, a safe and convenient
harbour;<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a>
there immediately after the Spanish armada had arrived, or as nearly as possible at the
same time with it, the fleet of transports from the Netherlands also was
to make the shore, and Alexander of Parma was then to assume the command
in chief of the whole force and march straight on London.</p>

<p>All that Philip II had ever thought or planned was thus concentrated as
it were into one focus. The moment was come when he could subdue
England, become master of the European world, and re-establish the
Catholic faith in the form in which he professed it. When the fleet (on
the 22nd July 1588) sailed out of Corunna, and the long-meditated,
long-prepared, enterprise was now set in action, the King and the nation
displayed deep religious emotion: in all the churches of the land
prayers were offered up for forty days; in Madrid solemn processions
were arranged to our Lady of Atocha, the patroness of Spain: Philip II
spent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
two hours each day in prayer. He was in the state of silent
excitement which an immense design and the expectation of a great turn
in a man's fortune call forth. Scarcely any one dared to address a word
to him.</p>

<p>It was in these very days that people in England first really became
conscious of the danger that threatened them. A division of the fleet
under Henry Seymour was watching, with Dutch assistance, the two
harbours held by the prince of Parma: the other and larger division,
just returned from Spain and on the point of being broken up, made ready
at Plymouth, under the admiral, Howard of Effingham, to receive the
enemy. Meanwhile the land forces assembled, on Leicester's
advice,<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a>
in the neighbourhood of London. The old feudal organisation of the
national force was once more called into full activity to face this
danger. Men saw the gentry take the field at the head of their tenants
and copyholders, and rejoiced at their holding together so well. It was
without doubt an advantage, that the threatened attack could no longer
be connected with a right of succession recognised in the country; it
appeared in its true character, as a great invasion by a foreign power
for the subjugation of England. Even the Catholic lords came forward,
among them Viscount Montague (who had once, alone in the Upper House,
opposed the Supremacy, and had also since not reconciled himself to the
religious position of the Queen), with his sons and grandsons, and even
his heir-presumptive who, though still a child, bestrode a war-horse;
Lord Montague said, he would defend his Queen with his life, whoever
might attack her, king or pope. No doubt that these armings left much to
be desired, but they were animated by national and religious enthusiasm.
Some days later the Queen visited the camp at Tilbury: with slight
escort she rode from battalion to battalion. A tyrant, she said, might
be afraid of his subjects: she had always sought her chief strength in
their good will: with them she would live and die. She was everywhere
received with shouts of joy: psalms
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
were sung, and prayers offered up in which the Queen joined.</p>

<p>For, whatever may be men's belief, in great wars and dangers they
naturally turn their eyes to the Eternal Power which guides our destiny,
and on which all equally feel themselves dependent. The two nations and
their two chiefs alike called on God to decide in their religious and
political conflict. The fortune of mankind hung in the balance.</p>

<p>On the 31st July, a Sunday, the Armada, covering a wide extent of sea,
came in sight of the English coast off the heights of Plymouth. On board
the fleet itself it was thought most expedient to attempt a landing on
the spot, since there were no preparations made there for defence and
the English squadron was not fully manned. But this was not in the plan,
and would, especially if it failed, have incurred a heavy
responsibility. Medina Sidonia was only empowered and prepared to accept
battle by sea if the English should offer it. His galleys, improved
after the Venetian pattern, and especially his galleons (immense sailing
ships which carried cannon on their different decks on all sides), were
without doubt superior to the vessels of the English. When the latter,
some sixty sail strong, came out of the harbour, he hung out the great
standard from the fore-mast of his ship as a signal for all to prepare
for battle. But the English admiral did not intend to let matters come
to a regular naval fight. He was perfectly aware of the superiority of
the Spanish equipment and had even forbidden boarding the enemies'
vessels. His plan was to gain the weather-gauge of the Armada, and
inflict damage on them in their course, and throw them into disorder.
The English followed the track of the Armada in four squadrons, and left
no advantage unimproved that might offer. They were thoroughly
acquainted with this sea, and steered their handy vessels with perfect
certainty and mastery: the Spaniards remarked with dissatisfaction that
they could at pleasure advance, attack, and again break off the
engagement. Medina Sidonia was anxious above all things to keep his
Armada together: after a council of war he let a great ship which lagged
behind fall into the hands of the enemy, as her loss would be less
damaging than the breaking up of the line which would result from the
attempt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
to save her: he sent round his sargentes mayores to the
captains to tell them not to quit the line on pain of
death.<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a></p>

<p>On the whole the Spaniards were not discontented with their voyage, when
after a week of continuous skirmishing they, without having sustained
any very considerable losses, had traversed the English channel, and on
Saturday the 6th August passed Boulogne and arrived off Calais: it was
the first point at which they had wished to touch. But now to cross to
the neighbouring coast of England, as seems to have been the original
plan, became exceedingly difficult, because the English fleet guarded
it, and the Spanish galleons were less able in the straits than
elsewhere to compete with those swift vessels, It was also being
strengthened every moment; the young nobility emulously hastened on
board. But neither could the admiral proceed to Dunkirk, as the harbour
was then far too narrow to receive his large ships, and his pilots were
afraid of being carried to the northward by the currents. He anchored in
the roadstead east of Calais in the direction of Dunkirk.</p>

<p>He had already previously informed the Duke of Parma that he was on the
way, and had then, immediately before his arrival at Calais, despatched
a pilot to Dunkirk, to request that he would join him with a number of
small vessels, that they might better encounter the English, and bring
with him cannon balls of a certain calibre, of which he began to fall
short.<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a>
It is clear that he still wished to undertake from thence,
if supported according to his views, the great attempt at a
disembarkation which he was commissioned to effect. But Alexander of
Parma, whom the first message had found some days before at Bruges, had
not yet arrived at Dunkirk when the second came: the preparations for
embarking were only then just begun for the first time; and they could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
scarcely venture actually to embark, as English and Dutch ships of war
were still ever cruising before the harbour.</p>

<p>Alexander Farnese's failure to effect a junction with Medina Sidonia has
been always traced to personal motives; it was even said in England, at
a later time, that Queen Elizabeth had offered him the hand of Lady
Arabella Stuart, which might open the way to the English throne for
himself. It is true that his enterprises in the Netherlands appeared to
lie closest to his heart; even Tassis, who was about his person, remarks
that he carried on his preparations more out of obedience than with any
zeal of his own. But the chief cause why the two operations were not
better combined lay in their very nature. The geographical relation of
the Spanish monarchy to England would have required two separate
invasions, the one from the Pyrenean peninsula, the other from the
Netherlands. The wish to combine the forces of such distant countries in
a single invasion made the enterprise, especially when the means of
communication of the period were so inadequate, overpoweringly helpless.
Wind and weather had been little considered in the scheme. In both those
countries immense materials of war had been collected with extreme
effort; they had been brought within a few miles of sea of each other,
but combine they could not. Now for the first time came to light the
full superiority which the English gained from their corsair-like and
bold method of war, and their alliance with the Dutch. It was seen that
a sudden attack would suffice to break the whole combination in pieces:
Queen Elizabeth was said to have herself devised the plan and its
arrangement.</p>

<p>The Armada was still lying at anchor in line of battle, waiting for news
from Alexander Farnese, when in the night between Sunday and Monday (7th
to 8th August) the English sent some fire-ships, about eight in number,
against it. They were his worst vessels which Lord Howard gave up for
this purpose, but their mere appearance produced a decisive result.
Medina Sidonia could not refuse his ships permission to slip their
anchors, that each might avoid the threatening danger: only he commanded
them to afterwards resume their previous order. But things wore a
completely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
different appearance the following morning. The tide had
carried the vessels towards the land, a direction they did not want to
take; now for the first time the attacks of the English proved
destructive to them: part of the ships had become disabled: it was
completely impossible to obey the admiral's orders that they should
return to their old position. Instead of this, unfavourable winds drove
the Armada against its will along the coast; in a short time the English
too gave up the pursuit of the enemy, who without being quite beaten was
yet in flight, and abandoned him to his fate. The wind drove the
Spaniards on the shoals of Zealand: once they were in such shallow water
that they were afraid of running aground: some of their galleons in fact
fell into the hands of the Dutch. Fortunately for them the wind veered
round first to the W.S.W., then to the S.S.W., but they could not even
then regain the Channel, nor would they have wished it; only by the
longest circuit, round the Orkney Islands, could they return to Spain.</p>

<p>A storm fraught with ruin had lowered over England: it was scattered
before it discharged its thunder. So completely true is the expression
on a Dutch commemorative medal, 'the breath of God has scattered them'
(<i>flavit et dissipati sunt</i>).</p>

<p>Philip II saw the Armada, which he had hoped would give the dominion of
the world into his hand, return home again in fragments without having,
we do not say accomplished but even, attempted anything worth the
trouble. He did not therefore renounce his design. He spoke of his wish
to fit out lighter vessels, and entrust the whole conduct of the
expedition to the Prince of Parma. The Cortes of Castille requested him
not to put up with the disgrace incurred, but to chastise this woman:
they offered him their whole property and all the children of the land
for this purpose. But the very possibility of great enterprises belongs
only to one moment: in the next it is already gone by.</p>

<p>First the Spanish forces were drawn into the complications existing in
France. The great Catholic agitation, which had been long fermenting
there, at last gained the upper hand, and was quite ready to prepare the
way for Philip II's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
supremacy. But Queen Elizabeth thought that the day
on which France fell into his hands would be the eve of her own ruin.
She too therefore devoted her best resources to France, to uphold Philip
II's opponent. When Henry IV, driven back to the verge of the coast of
Normandy, was all but lost, he was by her help put in a position to
maintain his cause. At the sieges of the great towns, in which he was
still often threatened with failure, the English troops in several
instances did excellent service. The Queen did not swerve from her
policy even when Henry IV saw himself compelled, and found it compatible
with his conscience, to go over to Catholicism. For he was clearly thus
all the better enabled to re-establish a France that should be
politically independent, in opposition to Spain and at war with it; and
it was exactly on this opposition that the political freedom and
independence of England herself rested. Yet as his change of religion
had been disagreeable to the Queen, so was also the peace which he
proceeded to make; she exerted her influence against its conclusion. But
as by it the Spaniards gave up the places they occupied on the French
coasts, which in their possession had menaced England as well, she could
not in reality be fundamentally opposed to it.</p>

<p>These great conflicts on land were seconded by repeated attacks of the
English and Dutch naval power, by which it sometimes seemed as if the
Spanish monarchy would be shaken to its foundations. Elizabeth made an
attempt to restore Don Antonio to the throne from which Philip II had
driven him. But the minds of the Portuguese themselves were very far
from being as yet sufficiently prepared for a revolt: the enterprise
failed, in an attack on the suburbs of Lisbon. The war interested the
English most deeply. Parliament agreed to larger and larger grants: from
two-fifteenths and a single subsidy (about £30,000), which was its usual
vote, it rose in 1593 to three subsidies and six-fifteenths; the towns
gladly armed ships at their own expense, and sailors enough were found
to man them: the national energy turned towards the sea. And they
obtained some successes. In the harbour of Corunna they destroyed the
collected stores, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
were probably to have served for renewing the
expedition. Once they took the harbour of Cadiz and occupied the city
itself: more than once they alarmed and endangered the West Indies. But
with all this nothing decisive was effected; the Spanish monarchy
maintained an undoubted ascendancy in Europe, and the exclusive
possession of the other hemisphere: it was the Great Power of the age.
But over against it England also now took up a strong and formidable
position.</p>

<p>Events in France exercised a strong counter-action on the Netherlands;
under their influence the reconquest of the United Provinces became
impossible for Spain. Elizabeth also contributed largely to the
victories by which Prince Maurice of Orange secured a strong frontier.
But these could not prevent a powerful Catholic government arising on
the other side in the Belgian provinces: and though they were at first
kept apart from Spain, yet it did not escape the Queen that this would
not last for ever: she seems to have had a foreboding that these
countries would become the battleground of a later age. However this
might be, the antagonism of principle between the Catholic Netherlands
(which were still ruled by the Austro-Spanish House) and the Protestant
Netherlands (in which the Republic maintained itself), and the continued
war between them, ensured the security of England, for the sake of which
the Queen had broken with Spain. Burleigh's objects were in the main
attained. </p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p class='centersm'><a name="BIII_VII" id="BIII_VII"></a>
THE LATER YEARS OF QUEEN ELIZABETH.</p>

<p>Every great historic existence has a definite purport; the life of Queen
Elizabeth lies in the transactions already recorded, and their results
in the change of policy which she brought about.</p>

<p>The issue of the war between the hierarchy, which had once swayed every
act and thought of the West, and those who had fallen off from it was
not yet decided as long as England with its power vacillated between the
two systems. Then this Queen came forward, attaching herself to the new
view as by a predetermined destiny; she carried it out in a form
answering to the historical institutions of her kingdom, and with an
energy by which she at the same time upheld that kingdom's power. It was
against her therefore that the hierarchy, when it could renew the
contest, mainly directed its most energetic efforts: an author of the
period makes those leagued with the Pope against the Queen say to each
other, 'come let us kill her, and the inheritance shall be ours.' The
chief among these was the mighty King who had himself once ruled
England. She maintained a war with this league, in which it was at each
moment a question of existence for her. She was assailed with all the
weapons of war and of treason; but she adopted corresponding means of
defence against every assault: she not only maintained herself, but
created in the neighbouring countries a powerful representation of the
principle which she had taken up, without pressing the adoption of a
form for it exactly like her own. Without her help the
church-reformation in Scotland, and at that time in France, would have
been probably suppressed, and in the Netherlands it would have never
taken actual shape. The Queen is the champion of West-European
Protestantism and of all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
political growth that was attached to the
new faith. She herself expresses her astonishment at her success in
this: 'more at the fact,' she says once, 'that I am still alive, than
that my enemies would not have me to live.' That Philip effected so
little against her, she believes to be due above all to God's justice;
for the King attacked her in an unkingly manner while negociations were
still going on: she sees in this a proof that an ill beginning leads to
a disgraceful end, despite all power and endeavour. 'What was to ruin
me, has turned to my
glory.'<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a></p>

<p>It is surely the greatest happiness that can be granted to any human
being, while defending his own interest, to be maintaining the interests
of all. Then his personal existence expands into a central part of the
world's history.</p>

<p>That personal and universal interest was likewise a thoroughly English
one. Commerce grew amidst arms: the maintenance of internal peace filled
the country with wellbeing and riches; palaces were seen rising where
before only huts had stood: as the philosophic Bacon remarks, England
now won her natural position in the world.</p>

<p>Elizabeth was one of those sovereigns who have beforehand formed an idea
for themselves as to the duties of government. Four qualities, she says
once, seemed to her necessary for it: justice and self-control,
highmindedness and judgment; she might pride herself on the two first:
never in a case of equal rights had she favoured one person more than
another: never had she believed a first report, but waited for fuller
knowledge: the two others she would not claim for herself, for they were
men's virtues. But the world ascribed a high degree of these very
virtues to her. Men descried her subtle judgment in the choice of her
servants, and the directing them to the services for which they were
best fitted. Her high heart was seen in her despising small advantages,
and in her unshaken tranquillity in danger. While the storm was coming
on from Spain, no cloud was seen on her brow: by her conduct she
animated nobles and people, and inspirited her councillors. Men praised
her for two things, for zealous participation in

deliberation and for care in seeing that what was decided on was carried into

<p>But we may not look for an ideal female ruler in Queen Elizabeth. No one
can deny the severities which were practised under her government even
with her knowledge. The systematic hypocrisy imputed to her may seem an
invention of her enemies or of historians not thoroughly informed; she
herself declares truthfulness a quality indispensable for a prince; but
in her administration, as well as in that of most other rulers,
reasonings appear which rather conceal the truth than express it; in
each of her words, and in every step she took, we perceive a calculation
of what is for her advantage; she displays striking foresight and even a
natural subtlety. Elizabeth was very accessible to flattery, and as
easily attracted by an agreeable exterior as repelled by slight
accidental defects; she could break out at a word that reminded her of
the transitory nature of human affairs or of her own frailty: vanity
accompanied her from youth to those advancing years, which she did not
wish to remark or to think were remarked. She liked to ascribe successes
to herself, disasters to her ministers: they had to take on themselves
the hatred felt against disagreeable or doubtful regulations, and if
they did not do this quite in unison with her mood, they had to fear her
blame and displeasure. She was not free from the fickleness of her
family: but on the other hand she displayed also the amiable attention
of a female ruler: as when once during a speech she was making in a
learned language to the learned men of Oxford, on seeing the Lord
Treasurer standing there with his lame foot, she suddenly broke off,
ordered a chair to be brought him, and then continued; indeed it was
said she at the same time wished to let it be remarked that no accident
could discompose her. As Harrington, who knew her from personal
acquaintance, expresses himself: her mind might be sometimes compared to
a summer morning sky, beneficent and refreshing: then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
she won the
hearts of all by her sweet and modest speech. But she was repellent in
the same degree in her excited state, when she paced to and fro in her
chamber, anger in every look, rejection in every word: men hastened out
of her way. Among other correspondence we learn to know her from that
with King James of Scotland,&mdash;one side of her political relations, to
which we shall return:&mdash;how does every sentence express a mental and
moral superiority as well as a political one! not a superfluous word is
there: all is pith and substance. From care for him and intelligent
advice she passes to harsh blame and most earnest warning: she is kind
and sharp, friendly and rough, but almost ever more repellent and
unsparing than mild. Never had any sovereign a higher idea of his
dignity, of the independence belonging to him by the laws of God and
man, of the duty of obedience binding on all subjects. She prides
herself on no external consideration influencing her resolutions,
threats or fear least of all; when once she longs for peace, she insists
on its not being from apprehension of the enemy, but only from
abhorrence of bloodshed. The action of life does not develop merely the
intellectual powers: between success and failure, in conflict and effort
and victory, the character moulds itself and acquires its ruling tone.
Her immense good fortune fills her with unceasing self-confidence, which
is at the same time sustained by trust in the unfailing protection of
Providence.<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a>
That she, excommunicated by the Pope, maintains herself
against the attacks of half the world, gives her whole action and nature
a redoubled impress of personal energy. She does not like to mention her
father or her mother: of a successor she will not hear a word. The
feeling of absolute possession is predominant in her appearance. It is
noticeable how on festivals she moves in procession through her palace:
in front are nobles and knights in the costume of their order, with
bared heads; next the bearers of the insignia of royalty, the sceptre,
the sword, and the great seal: then the Queen herself in a dress covered
with pearls and precious stones; behind her ladies,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
brilliant in their
beauty and rich attire: to one or two, who are presented to her, she
reaches out her hand to kiss as she goes by in token of favour, till she
arrives at her chapel, where the assembled crowd hails her with a 'God
save the Queen,' she returning them thanks with gracious words.
Elizabeth received the whole reverence, once more unbounded, which men
paid to the supreme power. The meats of which she was to eat were set on
the table with bended knee, even when she was not present. It was on
their knees that men were presented to
her.<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a></p>

<p>Between a sovereign like this and her Parliament points of contention
could not be wanting. The Commons claimed the privilege of absolute
freedom of speech, and repeatedly attacked the abuses which still
remained in the episcopal Church, and the injurious monopolies which
profited certain favoured persons. The Queen had members of the Lower
House imprisoned for speeches disagreeable to her: she warned them not
to interfere in the affairs of the Church, and even not in those of the
State, and declared it to be her prerogative to summon and dissolve
Parliament at her pleasure, to accept or reject its measures. But with
all this she still did not on the other hand conceal that, in reference
to the most important affairs of State, she had to pay regard to the
tone of the two Houses: however much she might be loved, yet men's minds
are easily moved and not thoroughly trustworthy. In its forms Parliament
studied to express the devotion which the Queen claimed as Queen and
Lady, while she tried to make amends for acts by which the assembly had
been previously offended: for statements of grievances, as in the
instance of the monopolies, she even thanked them, as for a salutary
reminder. A French ambassador remarks in 1596 that the Parliament in
ages gone by had great authority, but now it did all the Queen wished.
Another who arrived in 1597 is not merely astonished at its imposing
exterior, but also at the extent of its rights. Here, says he, the great
affairs are treated of, war and peace, laws, the needs of the community
and the mode of satisfying
them.<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a>
The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
one statement is perhaps as
true as the other. The solution of the contradiction depends on this,
that Queen and Parliament were united as to the general relations of the
country and the world. The Queen, as is self-evident, could not have
ruled without the Parliament: from the beginning of her government she
supported herself by it in the weightiest affairs; but a simple
consideration teaches us how much on the other hand Parliament owed
precisely to that introduction into these great questions, which the
Queen thought advisable. They avoided, and were still able to avoid, any
enquiry into their respective rights and the boundaries of those rights.
And besides Elizabeth guarded herself from troubling her Parliament too
much by demands for money. She has been often blamed for her economy
which sometimes became inconvenient in public affairs: as in most cases,
nature and policy here also coincided. That she was sparing of money,
and once was actually in a condition to decline a grant offered her,
gave the administration an independence of any momentary moods of
Parliament, which suited her whole nature, and without this might have
been easily lost.</p>

<p>William Cecil, Lord Burleigh, her treasurer, as economical as herself,
was likewise her first minister. He had assisted her with striking
counsel even before her accession, and since lived and moved in her
administration of the state. He was one of those ministers who find
their calling in a boundless industry,&mdash;he needed little sleep, long
banquets were not to his
taste:<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a>
never was he seen inactive even for
half an hour; he kept notes of everything great and small; business
accompanied him even to his chamber, and to his retirement at S.
Theobald's. His anxious thoughts were visible in his face, as he rode on
his mule along the roads of the park; he only lost sight of them for a
moment when he was sitting at table among his growing children: then his
heavy eyebrows cleared up, light merriment even came from his lips.
Every other charm of life lay far from him: for poetry and poets he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
had no taste, as Spenser was once made to feel: in literature he patronised
only what was directly useful; he recommended no one except for his
being serviceable. Magnanimous he was not; he was content with being
able to say to himself, that he drew no advantage from any one's ill
fortune. He was designated even then as the man who set the English
state in motion: this he always denied, and sought his praise in the
fact that he carried out the views of the Queen, as she adopted them
after hearing the plans proposed or even after respectful remonstrances.
He had to bear many a slander: most of the reproaches made against him
he brought himself to endure quietly: but if, he said, it could be
proved against him that he neglected the Queen's interest, the war
against Spain, and the support of the Netherlands, then he was willing
to become liable to eternal blame. He was especially effective also
through a moral quality&mdash;he never lost heart. It was remarked that he
worked with the greatest alacrity when others were most doubtful. For he
too had an absolute confidence in the cause which he defended. When the
enemies' fortune stood highest, he was heard to say with great
tranquillity, 'they can do no more than God will
allow.'<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a></p>

<p>By the side of this pilot of the state, Robert Dudley, who was promoted
to be Earl of Leicester, drew all eyes on himself as the leading man at
court. Burleigh was looked on as Somerset's creation, Dudley was the
youngest son of the Earl of Northumberland: for it was of advantage to
Elizabeth, especially at first, to unite around her important
representatives of the two parties which had composed her brother's
government. One motive for her attachment to Leicester is said to have
been the fact that he was born on the same day, and at the very same
hour with herself: who at that time would not have believed in the
ruling influence of the stars? But, besides this, the Earl dazzled by a
fine person, attractive manners, and an almost irresistible charm
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
of disposition. The confidential intimacy which Elizabeth allowed him
caused scandalous rumours, probably without ground; for if they had been
true, Leicester, who had his father's ambition, would have played a very
different part. Elizabeth heard of them; she once actually brought a
foreign ambassador into her apartments, to convince him how utterly
impossible it would be for her to see any one whatever without
witnesses; she censured a foreign writer for letting himself be deceived
by a groundless rumour, but she would not on this account dismiss the
favourite from court. She liked to have him about her, and to receive
his homage which had a tinge of chivalry in it: his devotion satisfied a
need of her heart. He could not however take any power to himself which
would infringe on her own supreme authority; once, when such a case
occurred, she reminded him that he was not in exclusive possession of
her favour: she could bestow it on whom she would, and again recall it;
at court, she exclaimed, there should be no Master, but only a
Mistress.<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a>
Neither did Leicester display great mental gifts: in the
campaigns of the Netherlands he did not at all answer even the moderate
expectations that had been formed of him. If the Queen nevertheless put
him at the head of her troops when the Spanish danger threatened, this
was because he possessed her absolute personal confidence.</p>

<p>With Leicester the Sidneys were most closely allied. Henry Sidney, his
sister's husband, introduced civilisation and monarchic institutions
into Wales, and was selected to extend them in Ireland. In his son
Philip the English ideal of noble culture seemed to have realised
itself; he combined a very remarkable literary power peculiar to
himself, and talents suited for the society of men of the world (which
well fitted him for the duties of an ambassador), with disinterested
kindness to others, and a chivalrous courage in war, which gained him
universal admiration both at home and in presence of the enemy.</p>

<p>Leicester's good word is also said to have opened an entrance to court
for young Walter Ralegh and to have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
promoted his first successes.
Ralegh combined in his own person the aspirations of the age in a most
vivid manner. He was ambitious, fond of show, with high aims, deeply
engaged in the factions of the court; but at the same time he had a
spirit of noble enterprise, was ingenious and thoughtful. In everything
new that was produced in the region of discoveries and inventions, of
literature and art, he played the part of a fellow worker: he lived in
the circle of universal knowledge, its problems and its progress. In his
appearance he had something that announced a man of superior mind and
nature.</p>

<p>Around Cecil were grouped the statesmen who had been promoted by him,
and worked in sympathy with him: for instance Bacon the Keeper of the
Seals, whom the Queen regarded as the oracle of the laws, and who also
amused her by many a witty word; Mildmay, the Chancellor of the
Exchequer, who though adhering to the principles now adopted yet gladly
favoured the claims of Parliament, and even the tendencies of the
Puritans; Francis Walsingham, Secretary of State, who had once suffered
exile for his Protestantism and now supported it after his return with
all the resources of the administration; it is said of him that he heard
in London what was whispered in the ear at Rome; he met the crafty
Jesuits with a network of secret counter-action which extended over the
world; there has never been a man who more vigilantly and unrelentingly
hunted down religious and political conspiracies; to pay his agents, in
choosing whom he was not too particular, he expended his own property.
Cecil and Bacon had married two daughters of that Antony Cooke, who had
once taken part in Edward VI's education: the other sisters, wedded to
Hobby and Killigrew, men who were engaged in the most important
embassies, extended the connexion of these statesmen. Walsingham was
allied by marriage with Mildmay, and with Randolph the active ambassador
in Scotland.</p>

<p>Once the Queen brought a man among them, who owed his rise only to her
being pleased with his person and conversation, which likewise brought
her much ill repute:<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a>
she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
promoted her vice-chamberlain Christopher
Hatton to be Lord Chancellor of England. The lawyers made loud and
bitter complaints of this disregard of their claims and their order.
Hatton had however been long on good terms with the leading statesmen:
in all the late questions of difficulty as to Mary Stuart's trial he had
held firm to them. His nephew and heir soon after married a
granddaughter of Burleigh.</p>

<p>The Queen's own relations on the mother's side had always some influence
with her. Francis Knolles who had married into this family, and was
appointed by the Queen treasurer of her household, won himself a good
name with his contemporaries and with posterity by his religious zeal
and openness of heart. A still more important figure in this circle is
Thomas Sackville, who is also named with honour among the founders of
English literature; the part of the 'Mirror for Magistrates' which was
due to him witnesses to an original conception of the dark sides of
man's existence, and to a creative imagination. But the poet likewise
did excellent service to his sovereign: he makes his appearance when an
important treaty is to be concluded, or the people are to be called on
to defend the country, or even when any agitation is feared in the
troubles at home. He was selected to inform the Queen of Scots that the
sentence of death had been pronounced on her. He is the Lord Buckhurst
from whom the dukes of Dorset are descended.</p>

<p>The distinguished family to which Anne Boleyn belonged, and which had
such an important influence on her rise, that of the Howards, proved in
its elder branch as little loyal to the daughter as it had once been to
the mother. On the other hand Elizabeth had experienced the attachment
of the younger line, that of Effingham, and had since repaid it with
manifold favours. From this branch came the Admiral, who commanded the
sea-force in the decisive attacks on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
the Spanish Armada. We know that
he was not himself a great seaman; but he understood enough of the
matter to enable him to avail himself of those who understood more than
he did. The Queen looked on him as the man marked out by Providence for
the defence of herself and of the country.</p>

<p>General Norris, who gained reputation for the English arms on the
continent by the side of Henry IV, was also related to her though more
distantly: besides this, she wished to repay him for the good treatment
she had formerly received in her distress from his grandfather.</p>

<p>How predominantly the personal element once more manifests itself in
this administration! As the Queen's own interest is also that of all,
those who belong to her family or have won her favour and done her
essential service, are the chiefs of the State and the leaders in war.
The royal patronage extended this influence over the Church and the
universities. But we find it no less in all other branches. Sir Thomas
Gresham, the Queen's agent in money-matters, was the founder of the
Exchange of London, to which she at his request gave the name of the
Royal Exchange.</p>

<p>In literature also we see the traces of her taste and her influence.
Owing to the tone of good society the classics were studied by every
one. The higher education was directed to them, as indeed the Queen
herself found in them refreshment and food for the mind: many classical
authors were translated, and the forms of the old poets revived or
imitated. The Italians and Spaniards, who had led the way in similar
attempts, further awoke the emulation of the English. In Edmund Spenser,
in whom the spirit of the age shows itself most vividly, we constantly
meet with imitations of the Latin or Italian poets, which here and there
aspire to be paraphrastic translations, and may be inferior to his
originals, even to the modern ones, in delicacy of drawing, since he
purposely selected their most successful passages: yet how thoroughly
different a spirit do his works breathe in their total effect! What in
the Italians is a play of fancy is in him a deep moral earnestness. The
English nation has an inestimable possession in these works of a moral
and religious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
grandeur, and a simple view of nature, which happily
expressed in single stanzas stamp themselves on every man's memory.
Spenser has assigned to allegory, as a style, a larger sphere than
perhaps belongs to it, and one allegory is always interweaving itself
with another; the heroes whom he takes from the old romances become to
him representatives of the different virtues, but he possesses such an
original power of vivid representation that even in this form he gains
the reader's interest. But, if we ask what is the main thing which he
celebrates, we find that it is precisely the course of the great war in
which his nation is engaged against the Papacy and the Spaniards. The
Faery Queen is his sovereign, whose figure under the manifold symbols of
the qualities which she possessed, or which were ascribed to her, is
always coming forward afresh in his verse. With wonderful power
Elizabeth united around her all the aspiring minds and energies of the
nation.</p>

<p>Not a few of the productions of the time have so strong an infusion of
reverence for the Queen that we cannot help smiling: but it is true
nevertheless that at her court the language formed itself, and all great
aspirations found their central point. Elizabeth's statesmen, who had to
deal with a Parliament that could not be led by mere authority, studied
the rules of eloquence in the models of antiquity, and made their
doctrines their own. On their table Quintilian lay by the side of the
Statutes.</p>

<p>The Queen, who loved the theatre and declared it a national institution
by a proclamation, made it possible for Shakespeare to develop himself;
his roots lie deep in this epoch, he represents its manners and mode of
life: but he spreads far out beyond it. We shall return to him in a more
suitable place than this, in which we are treating of the Queen's
influence.</p>

<p>It would contradict the nature of human affairs were we to expect that
the general point of view, which swayed the State as a whole, could have
induced every one who took part in its administration to move on to
their common aim in one way. Of the great nobles of the court many
rather supported the Puritans, as indeed the father of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
the Puritan Cartwright owed his position at Warwick to Leicester's protection;
others inclined to favour the Catholics. The severity which the bishops
thought themselves bound to exercise met with opposition among the
leading statesmen: and to these again the soldiers were opposed. It was
a society full of life, and highly gifted, but for that very reason in
continual ferment and internal conflict.</p>

<p>We have still to grasp clearly the event in which these antagonisms and
the Queen's temperament yet once more led to a great catastrophe.</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p>The aged Burleigh, who had provoked the war with Spain, wished also to
end it. From his past experience he concluded that he could not inflict
any decisive blow on the Spanish monarchy, which still displayed a vast
power of resistance; in 1597 it could again offer a high price for
peace. The Spaniards, who had taken Calais from the French by a sudden
attack, offered the Queen the restoration of this old English possession
in exchange for the strong places in the Netherlands, entrusted to her
in pledge.<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a>
For the Netherlands no other provision would have been
thus made than was proposed in 1587: but England would have again won as
strong a position on the Continent as it had before, and would have
established its rule over the neighbouring seas: an open commerce would
have been re-established, and Ireland freed from the hostile influence
of the Spaniards: the Queen would have enjoyed peace in her advancing
years. Burleigh saw as it were the conclusion of his life in this: he
said that, if God granted him a good agreement with Spain, his soul
would depart with joy.</p>

<p>But for this policy he could not possibly get the approval of the young,
whose ambitious hopes were connected with the continuance of the war.
They measured the power of the country by their own thirst for action.
If the Queen, so they said, would only not do everything by halves and
not follow her secretaries so much, she could, especially now she had
the Dutch as allies, tear the Spanish monarchy in pieces.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
How could they fail, with some effort, in occupying the Isthmus of Panama? And
then they would at one blow deprive the monarchy of all its resources.
And above all, the man who then played the most brilliant part at court,
Robert Devereux Earl of Essex, was of this opinion. He was Leicester's
stepson, introduced by him at court, and after his death his successor
as it were in the Queen's favour. An attractive manly appearance,
blooming youth, chivalrous manners, won him all hearts from the very
first. With the Queen he entered into that rare relation, in which
favour on the one side and homage on the other took the hues of mutual
inclination, and even passion.</p>

<p>What Essex's idea of it was he once revealed at a dramatic festivity
which he arranged for the Queen in honour of her accession. There he
made a hermit, an officer of state, and a soldier come forward and
address their exhortations to an esquire who was intended to represent
himself. By the first the knight was desired to give up all feelings of
love, by the second to devote his powers to State affairs, by the third
to apply himself to war. The answer is: the knight cannot give up his
passion for his lady, since she animates all his thoughts with divine
fire, teaches him true policy, and at the same time qualifies him to
lead an army. Essex had taken part in some campaigns of Henry IV, and
afterwards commanded the squadron which was in possession of the harbour
of Cadiz for a moment, but without being able to hold it: he also failed
in another enterprise which was planned to seize the plate-fleet; but
this did not prevent him from evermore designing fresh and comprehensive
plans. His view in this matter he also once represented
dramatically.<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a>
He brought forward a native American prince who
utters the wish to be freed from the Castilians and their oppressive
rule: an oracle refers him to the Queen whose kingdom lies between the
old and the new world, and who is naturally inclined to come to the aid
of all the oppressed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
The negociations for peace were wrecked mainly through their inherent
difficulties: the Spaniards however had no hesitation in ascribing the
ill result to the influence of the Queen's favourite, who had been won
over by the King of
France.<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a>
But the war could not after this be
waged on the grand scale contemplated, because Henry IV himself now
concluded peace, which freed the hands of the Spaniards to act against
England, and even awoke once more their ideas of an invasion.</p>

<p>Under the double influence of English oppression and the instigation of
both Spain and Rome a revolt broke out in Ireland, in which the English
suffered a defeat on the Blackwater, which is designated as the greatest
mishap they had ever suffered in that island. Ulster, Connaught, and
Leinster were in arms: their chief, Tyrone, who had learnt war in the
English service, came forward as The O'Neil, and was already recognised
by the Pope as sovereign of Ulster; the Irish reckoned on Spanish
assistance, either in Ireland itself, or through an attack on England.
Priests and Jesuits fed the Irish with hopes that this time they would
free themselves, and destroy the very memory of the English rule.</p>

<p>The Queen decided, in order to keep her hold on the island, to send over
an unusually strong armament of horse and foot: and Essex, who had
always been the loudest in blaming the errors of previous commanders,
could not avoid at last himself undertaking its direction, though he did
not do it with complete alacrity.</p>

<p>Though Burleigh was dead, his son Robert Cecil nevertheless maintained
himself in possession of the secretaryship of state and was at the head
of his father's old friends, joined as they were by others who were not
indeed his friends but were enemies of Essex. It was unwillingly that
Essex quitted the court and thus left the field open to them: especially
as his personal relation to the Queen was no longer what it had been of
old. Aspiring by nature, supported by the good opinion of the people (on
which his grand appearance and his bold spirit of enterprise had made
much impression), and by the devotion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
of brave officers who were ready
to follow him in any undertaking by land or sea, he presumed to desire
to be something for himself. He wished to be no longer absolutely
dependent on the nod of his mistress. The story goes that she once, in a
violent passion at his disrespectful conduct, gave him a box on the ear,
and that he laid his hand on his sword. Even in his letters expressions
indicating resistance break through his declarations of submission. His
friends indeed advised him to return to absolute obedience: then the
Queen would raise the man whom she honoured above all others. He
rejected this advice because he held that the Queen was a woman, from
whom one gets nothing but by superior authority. It almost appears as
though he thought he might obtain such an authority by the Irish war.</p>

<p>But he found this expedition far harder than he had expected. Previously
he had always said that the great rebel, Tyrone, must be tracked to
Ulster, where were the roots of his power, and conquered there: then the
rest of the country would return to obedience of itself. How great was
the astonishment when he now nevertheless began with a march into
Munster and Leinster, in which he wasted his resources without obtaining
any great success! He maintained that the Privy Council of Ireland had
urged him on to this: its members denied it. At last the campaign to the
North was undertaken: but in this region the Irish were found to have
the complete superiority: the Queen's newly-levied troops on the other
hand were neither adapted, nor quite willing, to venture on a decisive
action: the officers signed a protest against it: and Essex saw himself
obliged to enter into negociations with Tyrone.</p>

<p>The conditions which that chief demanded in return for his submission
are exceedingly comprehensive: complete freedom of the Catholic church
under the Pope, and a transfer of the dignities of state to the natives,
so that only a viceroy, who should always belong to the high nobility,
was to come from England: the chief Irish families were to be restored
to their old possessions, and freed from the most oppressive laws, for
instance that of wardship; and the Irish were to be allowed free trade
with England.<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a>
These stipulations would have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
promised a free development to the Irish nation, and made the yoke of England
exceedingly light. Essex accepted them, because the Spaniards were just
now threatening an attack on England, and Tyrone could only be separated
from them on these conditions; even then Tyrone begged that for the
present they might be kept a profound secret, that he might not quarrel
with the Spaniards too soon.</p>

<p>But how could such comprehensive concessions be expected from the proud
Queen? How could her counsellors, who always preferred direct
negociation with Spain, have accepted them?</p>

<p>The idea occurred to the Earl of Essex to return to England with a part
of his troops, and at their head enforce the acceptance of his treaty,
after which he would throw himself with all his might into the Spanish
war. And without doubt this would have been the only way to carry out
his plan, and become altogether master of the government.</p>

<p>But it was represented to him that this looked exactly like an attempt
at rebellion. Essex was induced to give it up, and make everything yet
once more depend on the influence which he was confident he could
exercise on the Queen by appearing in person. Even this however was a
great risk: he not merely had no leave to do so, but it had been
expressly forbidden him just previously: he thought it however the only
way of obtaining his end. Without even having announced his departure to
the Queen, he suddenly appeared with slight attendance at Nonsuch, her
country house.<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a>
He dismounted before the door, and did not even take
time to change his dress: as he was, with the dust of the journey on his
face and clothes, he hastened to the Queen: that he did not find her in
the reception-room did not check him; he rushed on into her chamber,
where he entered without being announced, and kissed her hand: her hair
was still flying about her face. At the first moment she received him
graciously&mdash;in a couple of hours he might see her again:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
when he returned to her at table, she began to reproach him. From minute to
minute the Queen predominated in her over the friend: by evening his
arrest was announced to him.</p>

<p>Already by his conduct in Ireland Essex had supplied food for the
slander of his enemies: how much more must this have been the case
through his self-willed return! As he was fond of tracing his descent
from royal blood, he was accused of even aspiring to the throne, after
the example of Bolingbroke: for this purpose he had leagued himself with
Tyrone and the Irish grandees, whose loyalty he praised notwithstanding
their revolt. We can say with certainty that the views of the Earl of
Essex never went so far. In the question as to the Queen's successor,
which occupied every one, he had taken his side for the rights of the
King of Scotland: he imputed to his enemies the design of favouring on
the other hand the claim of the Infant of Spain (which was at that time
put forward in all seriousness in a book much read) with the view of
purchasing peace by his recognition. He assigned, as the motive for his
conduct, his inability to endure the atheists, papists, and Spanish
partisans in the Queen's council: as a Christian he could not possibly
look on while religion perished, and as an Englishman he would not stand
aloof while his fatherland was being
ruined.<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a>
He had never wished to
be anything else than a subject&mdash;but 'only of his Queen, not the
underling of an unworthy and low vassal.' So far as men saw, he stood in
connexion with both the parties opposed to the prevailing system. He was
prayed for in the churches of the Puritans: Cartwright was one of his
friends; the Scotch doctrine, that the Supreme Power, if it showed
itself negligent in matters of religion, could be compelled by those
immediately under it to take them in hand, is said to have been preached
with reference to him. As Earl Marshal of England, Essex indeed thought
he possessed an independent right of interference. But the mitigation of
the ecclesiastical laws would also have benefited the Catholics;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
and it was among them that he had perhaps the most decided allies. If we might
combine his views into a whole, they were directed towards raising the
natives of America against Spain, at the same time that by toleration
both in England and Ireland he united all patriots in the war against
that power, in which he discerned that the chief interest of the nation
lay.</p>

<p>Essex remained a long while in the custody of the Keeper of the Seal,
who was favourably disposed towards him; then he was sentenced by the
Star Chamber not to exercise any longer his high offices as member of
the Privy Council, as Earl Marshal, and Master of the Ordnance, and to
live as a prisoner in his own house during the Queen's pleasure. He
seemed to reconcile himself to this fate, and behaved modestly for a
considerable time: he was still flattering himself with the hope of
regaining his sovereign's favour, when a monopoly was withdrawn from him
which formed the chief part of his income. This new victory of his
enemies was intolerable to him: he would not let himself be brought so
low by them as to be forced to live like a poor knight, without
influence and independence. The thought occurred to him that, if he
could but see the Queen once more, he might effect a change in his own
destiny and in that of England. The popularity he enjoyed in the
capital, the continued attachment of his old companions in arms, the
friendship of some considerable nobles, allowed him to entertain the
hope that he could attain this in despite of those around her, could
make himself master of the palace, and force her to summon a
Parliament&mdash;in which the change of government and the succession of the
King of Scotland should be alike confirmed. Essex was no longer the
blooming man of times past, he was seen moving along with his neck bowed
down, but he still had his mind fixed on wide-ranging and ambitious
thoughts: from his youth up elevated by good fortune and favour, he held
everything possible which he set his hand to do. On the 8th February
1601 an armed band assembled at his house under certain lords; the
Keeper of the Seal and his attendant, whom the Queen despatched in order
to inform herself of the cause of the agitation, were detained. Essex
dared to march<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
through the capital with his armed men, in order to
raise it on his behalf. He reckoned on the desertion of the city militia
to him, and the connivance of the city magistrates; but instead of
finding support he only excited astonishment. No one stirred in his
favour. He was scarcely able&mdash;for royal troops were soon in arms against
him&mdash;to make his way back to his house: there was nothing left for him
but to surrender at discretion.</p>

<p>At his trial the principle, which had already had so much weight in the
proceedings against Mary Stuart, was expressly stated, that every
attempt at rebellion must be looked on as directed against the life of
the reigning
sovereign.<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a>
A crisis had occurred which obliged
Elizabeth to execute the man for whom among all men living she cherished
the deepest and warmest feeling, just as formerly she had been forced to
condemn one of the grandees connected with her by blood, and then her
sister Queen of equal rights with herself&mdash;all of them for traitorous
attempts against her government and person. She said she would gladly
have saved Essex, but she was forced to let the laws of England take
their course.</p>

<p>Essex is to be compared with his contemporary Biron in so far as they
both rebelled against sovereigns with whom they had stood in the closest
relations. In both it was mainly injured self-esteem which goaded them
on. As Biron had a portion of the lower French nobility for him, so
Essex had the soldiers by profession and the officers of the army to a
great extent on his side: they both appealed once more to religious
antipathies. But above all they thought of again making room for the old
independence of the warlike nobles: they both succumbed to the authority
of the firmly-rooted power of the state.</p>

<p>At that time there were fresh negociations going on for a peace between
Spain and England; but they could as little now as before agree on the
great subjects in dispute, the question of the Netherlands, and the
interests of commerce, which at the same time involved points of
religion. And the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
Spaniards broke off negotiations all the more
readily, as exaggerated rumours of Essex's conspiracy resounded
everywhere, making a revolt in England appear possible. They then
instantly thought of a landing in an English harbour, and this the
Catholics promised to support with considerable bodies of horse and
foot. In Ireland, where the refusal of the concessions held out to them
by Essex revived the national enmities, the Spaniards really effected a
landing: under Don Juan d'Aguilar they occupied Kinsale: and hoped not
merely to become masters of Ireland but to cross from thence to their
friends' assistance in England.</p>

<p>Hence Queen Elizabeth, who perceived the connexion of these hostilities,
now reverted to the necessity of carrying on the war again on a larger
scale. Her view was chiefly directed to a new enterprise against
Portugal: its separation from Castile she held to be the greatest
European success that was possible: but she hoped to bring about a
change in Italy as well: there Venice was to attack the nearest Spanish
territories. When she called the Venetians to aid&mdash;among other things
she wished also to obtain a loan from the government&mdash;she put them in
mind how much her resistance to the Spanish monarchy had benefited the
European commonwealth: hence it was that Spain had been prevented from
carrying out her tyrannical views throughout the world, in the
Netherlands and in Germany, in France and Italy; the Republic, which
loved freedom, would recognise this. Elizabeth thought to resume the
war, if possible, at the head of all that part of Europe which was
opposed to Spain, and in league with Henry IV, with whom she negociated
on this subject. In the beginning of 1603 a squadron was fitted out
under Sir Richard Lawson to attack the coasts of the Pyrenean peninsula.
Men discussed the comparative forces which the two kingdoms could bring
into the field.</p>

<p>But the Queen's days were already drawing to a close.</p>

<p>In February 1603 the Venetian secretary Scaramelli had an audience of
her, and gives a report of it from which we see that she still
completely preserved her wonted demeanour. He found the whole court, the
leading ecclesiastics and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
temporal dignitaries, assembled around
her: they had been entertained with music. When he entered, the Queen
rose in her usual rich attire, with a diadem of precious stones, almost
encircled with pearls: rubies hung from her neck; and in her mien no one
could detect any decay of her powers. 'It is time at last,' she said to
the secretary, who wished to throw himself on his knees before her,
while she raised him with both hands, 'it is time at last for the
Republic to send its representative to a Queen by whom it has been
always honoured.' The letter of the Republic was handed to her, and she
gave it to the Secretary of State; after he had opened it and given it
back to her again, she sat down to read it: it contained a complaint
that Venetian ships had been seized by the English privateers, who then
made all seas unsafe. The English nation, she then said, is not so small
but that evil and thievish men may be found in it: while she promised
enquiry and justice, she nevertheless reverted to her main point that
she had received nothing from the republic during the forty-four years
of her government but grievances and demands,&mdash;even the loan had been
refused;&mdash;Venice had hitherto, contrary to her custom, not sent any
embassy to her; not, she thought, because she was a woman, but through
fear of other powers. Scaramelli answered that no temporal or even
spiritual sovereign had any influence on the Republic in such matters;
he ascribed the neglect to circumstances which no one could control. The
Queen broke off: I do not know, she added, whether I have expressed
myself in good Italian: I learned the language as a child, and think I
have not forgotten it. After that serious address she again seemed
gracious, and gave the secretary her hand to kiss, when she dismissed
him. The next day commissioners were appointed to enquire into his
grievances.<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a></p>

<p>At that time the affairs of Ireland were once more occupying the Queen.
The Spaniards had been compelled by Lord Mountjoy to leave the island;
he had beaten them together with the Irish in a decisive action: but,
despite his victory, many further conflicts took place, and the
rebellion was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
suppressed; Tyrone still maintained himself in the
hills and woods of Ulster; and, as a return of the Spaniards was feared,
Mountjoy too was at last disposed to come to an agreement with him. The
Queen was in her inmost soul against this, for only fresh rebellions
would be occasioned by it; she required an absolute surrender at
discretion: if she once allowed the rebels to have their lives secured
to them, she soon after retracted the concession. She even spoke of
wishing to go to Ireland, in person; the impression produced by her
presence would put an end to all revolt.</p>

<p>But at this moment a sudden alteration was remarked in her: she no
longer appeared at the festivities before Lent, which went off in an
insignificant style. At first her seclusion was explained by the death
of one of her ladies whom she loved, the Countess of Nottingham: but
soon it could not be concealed that the Queen herself was seized with a
dangerous illness: sleep and appetite began to fail her: she showed a
deep melancholy. 'No,' she replied to one of the kinsmen of her mother's
house, Robert Cary, who at that moment had come back to court and
addressed friendly words to her about her health, 'No Robin, well I am
not, my heart has been for some time oppressed and heavy;' she broke off
with painful groans and sighing, hitherto unwonted in her, now no longer
suppressed. It was manifest that mental distress accompanied the bodily
decay.<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a></p>

<p>Who has not heard of the ring which Elizabeth is said to have once given
to the Earl of Essex with the promise that, if it were presented to her,
she would show him mercy, whatever might have occurred: he had, so the
tale runs, in his last distresses wished to send it her through the
Countess of Nottingham: but she was prevented from giving it by her
husband who was an enemy of Essex, and so he had to die without mercy:
the Queen, to whom the Countess revealed this on her death bed, fell
into despair over it. The ring is still shown, and indeed several rings
are shown as the true one: as also the tradition itself is extant in two
somewhat varying forms; attempts have been made to get rid of the
improbabilities
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
of the first by fresh fictions in the
second.<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a>
They are both so late, and rest so completely on hearsay, that they can no
longer stand before historical criticism.</p>

<p>Nevertheless we cannot deny, as the reports in fact testify in several
places, that the remembrance of Essex weighed on the Queen's soul. It
must certainly have reminded her of him, that she was now brought back
exactly to the course he had insisted on, namely a friendly agreement
with the invincible Irish chief. She had allowed less imperious, more
compliant, declarations to reach Ireland. But was the man a traitor, who
had recommended a policy to which they had been forced to have recourse
after such repeated efforts? Had he deserved his fate at her
hands?<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a>
It was remarked that the anniversary of the day on which Essex two years
before had suffered on the scaffold, Ash Wednesday, thrilled through her
with heart-rending pain; the world seemed to her desolate, since he was
no longer there; she imputed his guilt to the ambition, against which
she had warned him, and which had misled him into steps, from the
consequences of which she could not protect him. But had she not herself
uttered the decisive word? She burst into self-accusing tears. Her
distress may have been increased by finding that her statesmen no longer
showed her the old devotion, the earlier absolute obedience. When they,
as we know, had framed a formal theory for themselves, that they might
act against an express command of the Queen, on the assumption of her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
general intention being directed to the public good, could the
sharp-sighted, suspicious, sovereign fail to perceive it? Could she fail
to remark the agitation as to her successor, which occupied all men's
minds, while the reins were slipping from her hands? The people, on
whose devotion she had from the first moment laid so much stress, and
partly based her government, seemed after Essex' death to have become
cold towards her.</p>

<p>In every great life there comes a moment when the soul feels that it no
longer lives in the present world, and draws back from it.</p>

<p>Once more Elizabeth had the English Liturgy read in her room: there she
sat afterwards day and night on the cushions with which it was covered,
in deep silence, her finger on her mouth: she rejected physic with
disdain.<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a>
Most said and believed she did not care to recover or to
live any longer, that she wished to die. When she was at last got to
bed, and had a moment left of consciousness and interest in the world,
she had the members of her Privy Council summoned: she then either said
to them directly that she held the King of Scotland to be her lawful and
deserving successor, or she designated him in a way that left no
doubt.<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a></p>

<p>Amidst the prayers of the Archbishop of Canterbury, who was kneeling by
her bed, she breathed her last.</p>

<p>It is not merely the business of History to point out how far great
personages have attained the ideals which float<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span> before the mind of man,
or how far they have remained below them. It is almost more important
for it to ascertain how far the universal interests, in the midst of
which eminent characters appear, have been advanced by them, whether
their inborn force was a match for the opposing elements, whether it
allowed itself to be conquered by them or not. There never was a
sovereign who maintained a conflict of world-wide importance amidst
greater dangers and with greater success than Queen Elizabeth. Her
grandfather had begun a political emancipation from the ruling
influences of the continent, her father an ecclesiastical one: Elizabeth
took up their task and accomplished it victoriously against Rome and
against Spain, while her people had an ever-increasing part in public
affairs, and thus entered into a new stage of development. Her memory is
inseparably connected with the independence and power of England. </p>

<h2><a name="INT_IV" id="INT_IV"></a>BOOK IV.</h2>

<p class='center'><br />FOUNDATION OF THE KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN. FIRST DISTURBANCES UNDER THE
STUARTS. </p>

<p>Under no dynasty in the world have great national changes been so
dependent on the personal aims of princes as in England under the
Tudors. Just as all Henry VIII's subsequent proceedings were determined
by the affair of the divorce, so also the policy of his three children
was due to the relations into which they were thrown by their birth.</p>

<p>No one however could derive the course of English history at this epoch
from this cause alone. How could Henry VIII have even thought of
detaching his kingdom from the Roman See, but for the ancient and
deep-seated national opposition to its encroachments? But the nation had
also for ages had manifold and deep sympathies with Rome; and Mary Tudor
allied herself with these. Together with subjective personal agencies,
national influences of universal prevalence were at work. The different
leanings of the sovereigns appear as exponents of opposite tendencies
already existing in the nation. The struggle between these was decided
when, as in the reign of Elizabeth, the most vigorous nature combined
with the most powerful interests and the most influential motives to
gain the mastery, although others of a different character were still by
no means suppressed.</p>

<p>Now however the energetic race of the Tudors had disappeared from the
throne. By the right of natural inheritance another family ascended it,
which had its roots and associations in Scotland, the crown of which
country it united with that of England. If a long time elapsed before
the English commonwealth was as closely attached to the new dynasty as
it had been to the old, under which it had developed; so it is also
clear that the point of view from which this dynasty started could not
be exactly the same as that which had hitherto prevailed. This could not
be expected under a prince who had already reigned for a quarter of a
century and had long ago taken up, in his native country, a firm
position with regard to the great conflicts of the age. This position we
must first of all endeavour to represent. </p>

<small>JAMES VI OF SCOTLAND: HIS ACCESSION TO THE THRONE OF ENGLAND.</small></p>

<p class='sect'><a name="BIV_I_II" id="BIV_I_II"></a>Origin of fresh dissension in the Church.</p>

<p>Our eyes again turn to the man to whom the last great religious and
political change in Scotland is mainly due&mdash;John Knox.</p>

<p>We find him, propped on his staff and supported on the other side by a
helping arm, stepping homewards from the church where he had once more
performed a religious service: the multitude of the faithful lined the
road, and greeted him with reverence. He could no longer walk alone, or
raise his voice as before; it was only in a more confined space that he
used still to gather a little congregation round him, to whom on
appointed days and at fixed hours he proclaimed the teaching of the
Gospel with unabated fire. He lived to hear of the wildest outbursts of
the struggle on the continent, and to pronounce his curse on the King of
France, who had taken part in the massacre of St. Bartholomew; but, in
one respect, he was more fortunate than Luther, who in his last days was
threatened with mischief from hostile elements about him which he could
not control; for around John Knox all was peace. He thanked God for
having granted him grace, that by his means the Gospel was preached
throughout Scotland in its simplicity and truth: he now desired nothing
more than to depart out of this miserable life; and thus, without pain,
in November 1572, after bearing the burden and heat of the day, he fell
asleep.</p>

<p>With him and his contemporaries the second generation of the reformers
came to an end. They had fought out the battle against the papacy, and
had established the foundations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
of a divergent system: now however a
third generation arose, which had to encounter violent storms within the
pale of the new confession itself.</p>

<p>In Scotland the Regents Mar and Morton now thought it necessary, even
for the sake of the constitution, in which the higher clergy formed an
important element, to restore episcopacy, which had been laid low in the
tumult of the times; and to fill the vacant offices with Protestant
clergy, appointed however in the old way, by the election of the
chapters on the recommendation of the Government: it was desired at the
same time to invest them with the power of ordination and a certain
jurisdiction. Knox was at least not hostile to this measure. The
resolution to convene an assembly of the Church at Leith was formed
while he was still alive, and was ratified by Parliament in January
1573.</p>

<p>But in the Church, which had formed itself in perfect independence by
means of free association, this project, which besides was spoiled by
many blunders in the execution, necessarily provoked strong opposition.
Andrew Melville may be regarded as Knox's successor in the exercise of
the authority of leader; a man of wide learning, who had in his
composition still more of the professor than of the preacher, and united
convictions not less firm than those of Knox with an equal gift of
eloquence. He however on principle excluded episcopacy in any form from
the constitution, as, in his opinion, the Scriptures recognised only
individual bishops: he especially disapproved of the connexion between
the bishops and the crown. The spiritual and the temporal powers he
considered to be distinct kinds of authority, of which the one was as
much of divine right as the other. But he did not regard the clergy or
ministry of preaching as alone charged with spiritual authority: he
thought that the lay elders formed the basis of this authority: that,
once elected, they were permanent, had themselves a spiritual rank,
watched over the purity of doctrine, took the lead in the call of the
preachers, and, together with these, formed assemblies by whose
conclusions every member of the congregation was bound. A General
Assembly erected on this basis had the legislative authority in the
Church, with the right of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
visitation and of spiritual correction. It
was incumbent on the King to protect them; but he was amenable to their
sentence. Such is the discipline laid down in the Second Book, which was
approved in the year 1578, in a General Assembly, of which Melville was
Moderator.<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a></p>

<p>With these opposite principles before his eyes, the young King grew up.
He showed himself to be imbued with the reformed doctrine, but he was
decidedly averse to this form of church government, which created a
power in the nation intended to counterbalance and withstand that of the
monarch. The political views of his teachers, highly popular as they
were, awoke in him, as was natural, the inborn feelings of a king. He
longed with all his soul for the restoration of episcopacy, which,
according to his view, was of almost chief importance for both Crown and
Church.</p>

<p>This was indeed a different strife from the battle between Catholicism
and Protestantism, which filled the rest of the world: but they had
points of contact with one another, inasmuch as the reform of doctrine
had almost everywhere put an end to episcopal government. And the larger
conflict was constantly exercising fresh influence on the state of the
question in Scotland.</p>

<p>When the Catholic party was on the point of becoming master of the young
King, the Protestant lords, as has been mentioned above, gained
possession of his person by the Raid of Ruthven. They were the champions
of Presbyterianism in the Church; but as they had been overthrown, and
overthrown moreover in consequence of the support which the King
received from an ambassador friendly to the Guises, that form of
government could not survive their fall. In the Parliament of 1584,
which obeyed the wishes of the ruling powers, enactments distinctly
opposed to it were passed. By these the constitution of the Three
Estates united in Parliament was ratified. They forbade any one to
attack the Estates either collectively or singly, and therefore to
attack the bishops. No meeting in which resolutions should be taken
about temporal or even about spiritual affairs was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
to be held without
the King's approval: no jurisdiction was to be exercised which was not
acknowledged by the King and the Estates. The judicial power of the King
over all subjects and in all causes, and therefore even in spiritual
causes, was therein expressly confirmed.</p>

<p>At that time however Jesuits and Seminarists effected an entrance into
Scotland as well as into other countries, and produced a great effect:
Father Gordon especially, who belonged to one of the most distinguished
families in the country, that of the Earls of Huntly, was exceedingly
active; and for two months the King allowed his presence at court. Who
could guarantee that the young prince would not be entirely carried away
by this current when his chief counsellor, with whom the final decision
mainly rested, belonged to the party of the
Guises?<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a>
A great reward was offered to him: he was to be married to an archduchess; and at some
future day, after the victory had been won, he was to be raised to the
throne of England and Scotland. When we take into consideration that
Melville, who set himself to oppose this influence, had spent ten years
at Geneva and among the Huguenots, we see plainly how the struggles
which distracted the continent threatened to invade Scotland as well.</p>

<p class='sect'><a name="BIV_I_III" id="BIV_I_III"></a>Alliance with England.</p>

<p>In this danger Queen Elizabeth, who for her own sake did not venture to
allow matters to go so far, resolved to interfere more actively in the
affairs of Scotland than she had hitherto done. It is not perfectly
clear what share her government had in the return of the exiled
Protestant lords, whose attack had compelled King James to allow the
conviction for high treason of his former minister and favourite, who
fled to France in consequence. But their return was certainly welcome to
her; and she advised the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
King not to alienate the great men of his
kingdom, that is to say the returned lords, from his own side. In the
instructions to her ambassador it is expressly said that he should aim
at withholding the King from any alliance with the League in France,
which was then growing powerful. She had just determined to make open
war upon the King of Spain, who guided all the proceedings of the
League; what could be more important for her than to retain the King of
one division of the island on her own side? For that object she need not
require him to support the Presbyterians; his point of view was the same
which she contended for in the Netherlands and in France, and very
closely akin to her own.</p>

<p>She had besides a great reward to offer him. Distasteful as it was to
her to speak of her successor, she then determined to give the King the
assurance that nothing should be done which was prejudicial to his
claim, and she agreed to a secret acknowledgment of
it.<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a>
Her ambassador gave expression to these views in Scotland, and she herself
spoke in similar terms to the Scottish ambassador in England.</p>

<p>The acceptance of these overtures by King James was the decisive event
of his life. He was not so blind as not to see that any promise on the
part of England, although not binding in regular form, afforded a kind
of certainty entirely different from all the assurances of the League,
however comprehensive. The Queen moreover pledged herself to a subsidy
that was very acceptable to the poverty of the Scots, while her
protection served the King himself as a stay against his nobles, whom he
dared not alienate, but on whom he could not allow himself to be
dependent.</p>

<p>Thus in July 1586 an offensive and defensive alliance was concluded at
Berwick between the King and Queen in order to protect the religion
adopted in their dominions, which, in the language of the Prayer-book,
they termed the 'Catholic,' and to repel, not only every invasion, but
every attempt on the person
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
of their majesties or their subjects,
without regard to any ties of blood or relationship. The King promised
the Queen to come to her assistance with all his forces in the event of
any attack on the Northern counties, and not to allow his subjects to
support any hostile movements which might take place in Ireland. Every
word shows how absolutely and entirely in the events that were at hand
he identifies the interests of England with his
own.<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></p>

<p>It was of more especial advantage to the Queen that James entirely
renounced the cause of his mother. He had exerted himself in her behalf,
but his intercession never went beyond the limits of friendly
representation. Mary's secret resignation of her claims in favour of
Philip II had certainly not been unknown to him; he complained on one
occasion that she threatened him on his throne and was as little
attached to him as to the Queen of England. He loudly condemned her
conspiracies against Elizabeth and gave utterance to the unfeeling
remark that she might drain the cup which she had mixed for herself. At
the trial of his mother he was content with obtaining an assurance from
the English Parliament, which was of great importance to him, that his
rights should not be impaired by her condemnation. The claims to the
English throne which brought Mary to destruction rather served to
strengthen her son, as it threw him altogether on the side of the
English system.<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a></p>

<p>On the approach of the Spanish armada James at once placed his power and
his person at the disposal of the Queen. He assured her that he would
behave not as a foreign prince, but as if he were her son and a citizen
of her realm. With unusual decision he put himself at the head of the
Protestant nobles, and pursued the Catholic lords who gave ear to those
Spanish overtures which he had resisted.</p>

<p>He now sought for a wife in a Protestant family. With the concurrence,
if not at the instigation, of the English ministers, he solicited the
hand of a daughter of Frederick II,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
King of Denmark, whom Elizabeth had
praised for adhering to the general interests of the Protestant world.
In this enterprise James was influenced by the consideration that if any
other state opposed his claims on England, Denmark with its naval power
could afford him substantial assistance. A touch of romance is imparted
to his youth by the circumstance that he set out in person to fetch home
his bride, who was detained in Norway by contrary winds, and who had
been promised to him by her mother after her father's death. Their
marriage was celebrated at Opslo (Nov. 23, 1589), but their homeward
voyage was now attended with difficulty; James therefore took his wife
over the snow-clad mountains and the Sound, back to her mother to
Kronborg and Copenhagen, and spent a couple of months there. He had many
conversations with the divines of the country, during which the idea of
an union of both Protestant confessions was mooted. He also paid a visit
to Tycho Brahe on the island of Hveen, which gave him indescribable
pleasure: he believed that in his company he fathomed the marvels of the
universe, and lauded the astronomer in spirited Latin verse as the
friend of Urania, and as the master of the starry
world.<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a>
And a general influence was exercised in Europe both by his alliance with the
house of Oldenburg, and the connexion which he formed through it with
many of the most distinguished families in Germany. His consort was
niece of the Elector of Saxony, sister-in-law of the Elector of
Brandenburg, and granddaughter of the German Nestor, Ulric of
Mecklenburg. Her sister had just married Henry Julius Duke of Brunswick;
at whose marriage, which was celebrated at Cronberg, a company of North
German princes met together, which seemed like one single family. But
the days of this assemblage were not occupied with banquets and
festivities alone. To the impression which was then made on James may be
traced the despatch of an embassy to the Temporal Electors of the
Empire, which he deputed soon after his return to invite them to mediate
between England and Spain. If the King of Spain were disinclined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
for peace, he thought that a powerful alliance should be formed against him
for the maintenance of religion.</p>

<p>For such an alliance as this, England and Scotland seemed to offer a
centre. In an assemblage of the clergy, the King had once congratulated
himself on living at a time when the light of the Gospel was shining;
and in the same spirit his Chancellor gave Lord Burleigh to understand,
that this British microcosm, severed from the rest of the world, but
united internally by language, religion, and the friendship of its
princes, could best oppose the bloodthirstiness of an anti-Christian
League.<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a></p>

<p class='sect'><a name="BIV_I_IV" id="BIV_I_IV"></a>Renewal of the Episcopal Constitution in Scotland.</p>

<p>In Scotland, as well as elsewhere, the waves of the all-prevailing
struggle kept raging.</p>

<p>Embassies went backwards and forwards between Spain and the powerful
lords, Huntly, Errol and Angus, who kept alive Catholicism in the
Highlands; and a plan was formed to assemble a force of Scots and
Spaniards in Scotland, which should first overthrow the forces of that
country, and thence advance into
England.<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a>
King James at least
believed that he had gathered a definite statement to this effect from
an examination of those who had been arrested. Philip the Second's
design of getting the crown of France into his own family would have
been powerfully seconded by this undertaking, by which it was designed
to treat Great Britain in the same way. In the beginning of 1593 we find
James at Aberdeen engaged on a campaign against the Highlands: the
lesser nobles and the Protestants were on his side: the great earls were
driven back into the most remote districts as far as Caithness, and the
larger part of their domains fell into the hands of the King. But they
were not yet entirely conquered, and the next Parliament showed that
they had the greater part of the nobility on their side. No one wished
to be too severe on
them;<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a>
even the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
legal advisers of the crown
recommended the King not to commence a suit against them, in which they
might probably be acquitted. It is impossible to describe the
displeasure which affected Elizabeth on this turn of affairs, which she
ascribed to the pusillanimous and negligent government of James. Did he
not know, she asked, that the religion of the rebels was only a cloak
for treason? Would he trust men who had so often betrayed him? He could
never expect them to keep their plighted faith in the future, if their
great offences in the past were not even acknowledged: a lax government
set all turbulent spirits in motion, and led to shipwreck. With this
advice, and similar suggestions from the clergy, came the news of fresh
commotion. Francis Stuart, who had been made Earl of Bothwell by James,
but who after this had given great trouble by frequently changing sides,
had now joined the Catholic lords; and a plan had been concerted between
them to deal with James as they had formerly dealt with his mother, to
make him prisoner, and to put the prince just born to him in his place.
At last in September 1594 we find the King again in the field. The young
Argyle, whom he sent before him as his lieutenant, was met by the earls
in open fight, but they did not venture to encounter the King himself.
He took Strathbogie, the splendid seat of the Earls of Huntly; Slaines,
the principal castle of the Earls of Errol; some strongholds in Angus;
Newton, a castle of the Gordons; and had most of them razed. Even in
these districts he proceeded at last to erect a regular government in
the name of the King. His superiority was so decided that the earls left
Scotland in the spring of 1595; Father Gordon also followed them
reluctantly, after he had once more said mass at Elgin. But even this
was not such a defeat of the Catholic party as might have been followed
by their annihilation. The earls felt the hardships of exile with double
force from the loss of the consideration which they had enjoyed at home;
and when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
they offered their submission to the King, and satisfaction to
the Scottish Church, James and his Privy Council were quite ready to
accede to their offer: for they thought that disunion with his most
powerful lieges lessened the reputation of the crown, and might be very
dangerous at some future time if the throne of England became vacant; as
these important personages might then, like Coriolanus, side with the
enemy.</p>

<p>The only question now was, how the Presbyterian Church would regard
this. James had come to a general understanding with the Church, when
they made common cause against the League. In the year 1592 an agreement
was arrived at, by which the King gave a general recognition to
Presbyterianism, although he still left some grave questions undecided;
for instance, that of the rights of the Crown, and the General
Assemblies. But in proportion as he now gave intimation of a retrograde
tendency in favour of the Catholic lords, he roused the prejudices of
the Protestants against himself. They told him that the lords had been
condemned to death according to the laws of God, and by the sentence of
Parliament, the Great Assize of the kingdom: that the King had no right
to show mercy in opposition to these. He had allowed their return into
the country; the Church demanded the renewal of their exile: not till
then would it be possible to deliberate upon the satisfaction offered by
them. All the pulpits suddenly resounded with invectives against the
King. The proud feeling of independent existence was roused in all its
force in the breasts of the churchmen. Andrew Melville explicitly
declared, that there were two kingdoms in Scotland, of which the Church
formed one: in that kingdom the sovereign was in his turn a subject;
those who had to govern this spiritual realm possessed a sufficient
authorisation from God for the discharge of their functions. The Privy
Council might be of opinion that the King must be served alike by Jews
and heathens, Protestants and Catholics, and become powerful by their
aid; but in wishing to retain both parties he would lose both. The King
forced himself to ask support for his projects from Robert Bruce, at
that time the most prominent of the preachers, who answered him, that he
might make his choice, but that he could not have both the Earl of
Huntly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
and Robert Bruce for his friends at the same
time.<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a></p>

<p>By dealing gently with the Catholic lords the King had intended not only
to win them over to his side, but also in prospect of the English
succession, which was constantly before his eyes, to give the English
Catholics a proof of the moderation of his intentions. Even in Scotland
he wished not to appear the sovereign of the Presbyterian party alone.
It was absolutely repugnant to him to adopt the ideas of the Church
entirely as his own. But the leaders of the Church were bent on shutting
him within a narrow circle in accordance with their own ideas, from
which there should be no escape. In his clemency to Catholic rebels they
saw a leaning to that Catholicism which fought against God and
threatened themselves with destruction. The efforts which had been
necessary to overpower these adversaries, and the obligations under
which they had laid the King himself during the struggle, inspired them
with resolution to bind him to their system by every means in their
power.</p>

<p>But as the King also adhered to his own views, a conflict now broke out
between them which holds a very important place in the history of the
State as well as of the Church of Scotland.</p>

<p>The King ordered the Commissioners of the Church, who made demands so
distasteful to him, to leave the capital. The preachers then turned to
the people. From the pulpit Robert Bruce set before an already excited
congregation the danger into which the ecclesiastical commonwealth had
fallen owing to the return of the Catholic lords and the indulgence
vouchsafed to them; and invited those present to pledge themselves by
holding up their hands to the defence of their religion on its present
footing. They not only gave him their assent, but went so far as to make
a tumultuous rush for the council-house in which the King was sitting
with some members of the Privy Council and the Lords of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
Session. With difficulty was the tumult so far quieted as to allow James to retire to
Holyrood.<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a>
Here a demand was laid before him to remove his
councillors, to allow the commissioners to resume their functions, and
to banish the lords again from the country. It was intended that
religious profession should supply a rule for the guidance of the State.</p>

<p>But in political conflicts nothing is more dangerous than to overstep
the law by any act of violence. It was the violence attempted by the
leaders of the Presbyterians against the King, their attack on the
rights of his crown, that procured him the means of resistance. He
betook himself with his court to Linlithgow and there collected the
nobles, who for the most part stood by him, the borderers, whose leaders
the Humes and Kerrs took up arms for him, and bodies of Highlanders, a
force to which the magistrates succumbed, not wishing their city to be
destroyed; so that even the ministers thought it advisable to leave. On
New-Year's Day 1597 James made his entry with a warlike retinue into
Edinburgh, where a convention of the Estates met and passed decisive
resolutions in his favour. Both the provost and baillies of the town
were obliged to take a new oath of fealty by which they bound themselves
to suffer no insults to the King and his councillors from the pulpit:
and it was resolved that the citizens should henceforth submit the
magistrates of their choice to the King for his approval. The right of
deposing the ministers was assigned to the King, who was acknowledged
sole judge of all offences, even of those committed in sermons and
public worship.<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a></p>

<p>The King had now the Temporal Estates on his side; for however popular
the footing on which the Presbyterian Church might be constituted, no
one wished to give it uncontrolled sway. King James was able to form
plans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
for transforming its constitution in such a manner as to make it
consistent with the authority of the crown.</p>

<p>A series of questions which he dedicated to the consideration of the
public was well calculated to further his end. He asked whether the
external regimen of the Church might not be controlled both by King and
clergy, and the legislative power be vested in them in common. Might not
the King, as a religious and pious magistrate, have the power of
summoning General Assemblies? Might he not annul unjust sentences of
excommunication? Might he not interfere if the clergy neglected their
duties, or if the bounds of the two jurisdictions became doubtful.</p>

<p>At the next assembly of the Church at Perth (Feb. 1597) the current set
in the opposite direction. 'Mine eyes,' so says one of the most zealous
adherents of the Church, 'witnessed a new sight, preachers going into
the King's palace sometimes by night, sometimes in the morning,&mdash;mine
ears heard new sounds.' The greatest pains had been taken to secure the
presence of a number of ministers from the northern provinces, who were
still more anxious about the spread of their doctrines than about
controversies touching the constitution of the Church; and who rather
reproached the clergy of the southern counties with having taken on
themselves the government of the Church. But even among the latter the
King, who spared neither threats nor flatteries, won adherents. Moreover
an opinion gained ground that concessions must be made to him, as far as
conscience allowed, in order not to alienate him entirely from the
Church or drive him to take the opposite side. The answers to his
questions contained admissions. The right of taking the initiative in
everything relating to the external government of the Church was
conceded to him, together with a share in the nomination of ministers in
the principal towns; properly speaking the patronage of the Church in
these towns was made over to him. The Church itself made a most
important concession in renouncing its right of using the pulpit to
attack the crown. Henceforward no one was to venture to impugn the
measures of the King, until an officer of the Church had made a
remonstrance to him on the subject.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
And the same ideas prevailed also
in the subsequent assemblies at Dundee and Perth. The former of these
conceded to the King a share in all the business which the Church took
in hand; it allowed him to stay the proceedings of the Presbyteries when
they ran counter to the royal jurisdiction or to recognised rights. In
Dundee the excommunicated lords were admitted to a reconciliation and
acknowledged as true vassals of the King, after making a declaration by
which they acknowledged the Scottish to be the true Church; although the
stricter party would not even then forgive them. But the point of chief
importance was that the King succeeded in getting a Commission formed to
co-operate with him in maintaining peace and obedience in the kingdom.
Invested with full powers by the Church but dependent on the King, this
Commission procured him a preponderating influence in all ecclesiastical
affairs. For the most part it consisted of men of moderate views.</p>

<p>There is a contemporary narrative of the decay of the Church in Scotland
which begins from this date. For here, it was thought, ended the period
during which the word revealed from Sinai and Zion to the apostles and
prophets was the only rule of doctrine and Church discipline without any
mixture of Babylon or the City of the Seven Hills, or of policy of man's
devising; when the Church was 'Beautiful as the morning, fair as the
moon, clear as the sun, terrible as an army with banners.'</p>

<p>James, who regarded all this as due merely to the opposition of enemies,
went on his way without bestowing further consideration on the depth,
strength, and inward significance of this spirit which was destined once
more to agitate the world. He again took up in serious earnest the
design of erecting a Protestant episcopacy which had been entertained by
Mar and Morton. Not only was this necessary for the constitution but for
the sake of the clergy also: as George Gladstaine explained before a
large assembly at Dundee, it was desirable that they should take part in
the exercise of the legislative power. A small majority, but still a
majority, in this assembly decided in favour of the proposal. The King
assured them that he wished neither for a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
Papistical nor for an English
prelacy; he wished only that the best clergy should take cognizance of
the affairs of the Church in the council of the nation. In order to
unite both interests he desired that the General Assembly should propose
to the King six candidates for each vacancy and should have the right of
giving instructions to the King's nominee for his Parliamentary action,
and of demanding an account from him of his execution of the same. The
King esteemed it a great triumph when in the Parliament of 1600 he was
able actually to introduce two bishops whom he had nominated with the
concurrence of a Commission of the Synods.</p>

<p>It appears a general result worth noticing that he had again brought
both parties in the country into subjection to the crown, the one
however by open battle, the other by compliance which had somewhat the
air of inclination towards it.</p>

<p class='sect'><a name="BIV_I_V" id="BIV_I_V"></a>Preparations for the Succession to the English Throne.</p>

<p>That the former of these parties was properly speaking Protestant, and
the latter in its sentiment Catholic, created a certain feeling of
surprise. Queen Elizabeth, who had been attacked and insulted by the
Presbyterians sometimes even from the pulpit, could not find fault with
the crown for liberating itself from the ascendancy of the new Church as
it had done from that of the old: on the contrary she had expressly
approved of this policy; but she warned the King not to allow himself to
be so blinded by personal preference as again to put confidence in any
traitor, and not to separate himself from the flock which must fight for
him if he wished to stand. In the case of Scotland, as well as in the
case of her own dominions, she always kept before her eyes the contrast
between the Catholic and the Protestant principle, in comparison with
which all other differences appeared to her subordinate.</p>

<p>In his own views less rigid and consistent, King James had on the
contrary even made advances to the Papacy. He at one time found it
advisable to enter into relations with Pope Clement VIII, whose
behaviour about the absolution
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
of Henry IV showed that he did not at
least belong to the party of Spain and the zealots. A letter to the Pope
was forwarded from the Scottish cabinet addressing him as Holy Father,
with the signature of the King as his obedient son. A Scot, by
profession a Catholic, afterwards made the statement that, at the time
when Pope Clement was encamped before Ferrara, he had been sent to him
in order to seek his friendship, and to promise him religious liberty
for the Catholics if King James should ascend the English
throne.<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a></p>

<p>According to the account of King James himself Pope Clement invited him
to return to the Catholic faith; to whom he made answer, that the
prevailing controversies might be again submitted to a general council;
and that to the decision of such a council he would submit himself
unconditionally. Clement replied that he need not speak of a council,
for at Rome no one would hear of it; that the King had better remain as
he was. These transactions are still enveloped in doubt and obscurity:
the announcements of pretended agents cannot be depended on. There were
often men who did not fully share in the secret and who in consequence
far outran their
commission.<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a>
But it cannot be denied that there
were attempts at an approximation. Among the English refugees after
Mary's death two parties had arisen, one of which supported the Spanish
claims, while the other was quite ready to acknowledge King James
supposing that some concessions were made. Every day men who were
inclined to Catholicism were seen rising into favour at the Scottish
court. It was remarked that the Secretary of State, the Lord Justice,
and the tutors of the royal children, were Catholics. Queen Anne of
Scotland does not deny that many attempts were made to bring her back to
the old religion: though she assures us that she did not hearken to
them, it is notwithstanding undeniable that she felt a strong impulse in
that direction. She received relics which were sent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
her from Rome,
probably from superstition rather than from reverence for the saints,
but at all events she received them. Her intimate friend, the Countess
of Huntly, who often shared the same bed with the Queen, fostered these
views in her. King James remained unaffected by them. He attended
sermons three times a week; he was riveted to Protestantism by
convictions which rest on learning: but how did it come to pass that he
allowed these deviations from Protestantism about him? Was it from
weakness and connivance, or was it from policy?</p>

<p>With the English Catholics also he established a connexion. Offers and
conditions with a view to his succession were put before him; and
English Catholics presented themselves at his court in order to proceed
with the business or to maintain the connexion.</p>

<p>All this threw Queen Elizabeth into a state of great excitement. It was
insufferable to her that any one should even speak of her death, or, as
she said, celebrate her funeral beforehand. But now when James without
her knowledge formed relations with her subjects, she regarded his
conduct as an affront. Through her ambassador in Scotland she had an
English agent named Ashfield arrested, and gained possession of his
papers. Great irritation on both sides ensued, of which the
above-mentioned correspondence between the King and Queen gives
evidence. In angry letters the latter complained of the disparaging
expressions which James had let fall in his Parliament. In respectful
language but with unusual emphasis the King complained that the
accusations of an adventurer charging him with a plot against the life
of the Queen were not repressed in England with proper severity. A
period followed during which James expected nothing but further acts of
hostility from Elizabeth's ministers. He pretended to know that the
claims to the throne advanced by his cousin the Lady Arabella, daughter
of Charles Darnley, the younger brother of his father Henry, who had the
advantage of not being a foreigner, supplied them with a motive for
their proceedings. He even thought it possible that a book published by
Parsons under the name of Doleman, which maintained the claims of
Isabella daughter of King Philip,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
was inspired by the English ministers
themselves in order to throw his rights into the background. He ascribed
to them the intention of coming to an agreement with the Spaniards to
his disadvantage, only in order to maintain their own power.</p>

<p>So far the dislikes of King James and the Earl of Essex coincided.
Although a formal understanding between them cannot be proved, they were
nevertheless allies up to the point of regarding the Queen's ministers
as their enemies.</p>

<p>Very significant were the instructions which James gave to an embassy
which he despatched to England after the downfall of the Earl. His
ambassadors were directed to ascertain whether the popular discontent
went so far as to contemplate the overthrow of the Queen and her
ministers, in which case they were to take care that the people 'invoked
no other saint,' i.e. sought protection and support from no one else but
him. Above all he wished to be assured with regard to the capital that
it would acknowledge his right: he wished to form ties with the leading
men in the civic and learned corporations; the greater and lesser nobles
who inclined to him were to have early information what to do in certain
contingencies, and to keep themselves under arms. As he had always
thought it possible that he might require naval assistance from Denmark,
so now he instigated a sort of free confederation of the magnates and
barons of Scotland: they were to prepare their military retainers in
order to enforce his rights. Not that he had formed any design against
the Queen, but he believed that after her death he must give battle to
her ministers in order to gain the crown, and he appeared determined not
to decline the contest.</p>

<p>In reality however this mode of action was foreign to his nature. How
often he had said that a man must let fruit ripen before plucking it:
and a foreign prince, to whose sayings he attached great value, had
advised him to proceed by the safest path. This was the Grand Duke
Ferdinand of Tuscany, who then played a certain part in Europe, as he
had set on foot the alliance between Henry IV and the Pope
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
in opposition to Spain: Mary de' Medici, Queen of France, was his niece.
With the house of Stuart also he stood on the footing of a relation: his
consort, like the mother of King James, was a scion of the house of
Lorraine, and a marriage at some future day between the King's eldest
son and the daughter of the Grand Duke was already talked of. This
relationship, and Ferdinand's reputation for great political
far-sightedness and prudence, caused his advice to exercise great
influence on James's decisions, as James himself tells us. So long as
victory wavered between Essex and his opponents, or, as he conceived,
between the existing government and the people, James did not declare
himself: when the issue was decided he gave his policy a different
direction and made advances to the ruling ministers, whom up to this
time he had regarded as his enemies.</p>

<p>They were quite ready and willing to meet him. Robert Cecil asserted
later that he had by this means best provided for the safety and repose
of the Queen, for that by an alliance between the government and the
heir to the crown the jealousy of the Queen was best appeased: yet still
he observed the closest secrecy with regard to it. It is known that he
dismissed a secretary because he feared that he might see through the
scheme and then betray it. He thought that he was justified in keeping
the Queen in ignorance of a connexion that could only be distasteful to
her at her advanced age, which had deepened the suspicion natural to her
disposition, although at the same time this connexion was indispensable
for her repose. These ministers were tolerably independent in their
general conduct of affairs. They had embarked on other negotiations also
without the knowledge of the Queen; they thought such conduct quite
permissible, if it conduced to the advantage of England. And was not
Robert Cecil moreover bound to seize an opportunity of calming the
prejudices of the King of Scotland against himself and his house, which
dated from his father's participation in the fate of Queen Mary? This
was the only way of enabling him to prolong his authority beyond the
death of his mistress, with which it would otherwise have expired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
The letters are extant which were exchanged in these secret transactions
between Henry Howard, whom the Secretary of State employed as his
instrument, and a minister of King James. They are not so instructive as
might have been expected; for the Asiatic style of Howard, which serves
him as a mask, throws a veil even over much which we should like to
know. But they now and then open a view into the movements of parties,
especially in reference to the opposition of Cecil and his friends to
Raleigh and Cobham, which towards the close of the Queen's reign filled
the court with suppressed uneasiness.</p>

<p>The intercourse which had been opened certainly had the effect of once
more putting England and Scotland on a friendly footing. One of his most
trusty councillors, Ludovic Earl of Lennox, son of that Esmé Stuart who
at one time had stood so high in the King's esteem, was sent by James on
a mission to the Queen, in order to convince her of his continued
attachment;<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a>
and this ambassador in fact found favour with her.
James declared himself ready to send his Highlanders to the assistance
of the Queen in Ireland, and to enter as a third party into the alliance
with France against Spain, if it were brought about. He did not hesitate
to give her information of the advances which had been made by the other
side, even by the Roman court. Among these he mentioned a mission of
James Lindsay for the purpose of bringing him to promise toleration to
the Catholics. It may be doubted whether it is altogether true, as he
affirms, that he declined the proposal: but the Roman records attest
that Lindsay in fact could get nothing from him but
words.<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a></p>

<p>It is enough to remark that on the whole the views of James were again
brought into harmony with those of the Queen: but that does not mean
that he had also broken off all relations with the other side. It would
have been extremely dangerous for him if Pope Clement had pronounced
against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
him the excommunication which was suspended over Elizabeth, and
he was very grateful to the Pope for not going so far. And if he would
not agree to treat the Catholics with genuine toleration, yet without
doubt he let them hope that he would not persecute those who remained
quiet.<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a>
It was probably not disagreeable to him if they looked for
more. He was of opinion that he ought to have two strings to his bow.</p>

<p>He had now formed connexions with all the leading men in England of
whatever belief. There was no family in which he had not won over one
member to the support of his
cause.<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a></p>

<p class='sect'><a name="BIV_I_VI" id="BIV_I_VI"></a>Accession to the Throne.</p>

<p>Thus on different sides everything had been carefully prepared
beforehand when the Queen died. Although it may be doubtful whether she
had in so many words declared that James should be her successor, yet it
is historically certain that she had for a long time consented to this
arrangement. The people had not yet so entirely conquered all hesitation
on the subject.</p>

<p>At the moment of the Queen's decease the capital fell into a state of
general commotion. Perhaps 40,000 decided Catholics might be counted in
London, who had considered the government of the Queen an unauthorised
usurpation. Were they now to submit themselves to a King who like her
was a schismatic? Or were there grounds for entertaining the hope held
out to them that the new prince would grant them freedom in the exercise
of their religion. People pretended to find Jesuits in their ranks who
were accused of stimulating the excitement of their feelings: and the
government thought it necessary to arrest or keep an eye upon a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
number of men who were regarded as leaders of the Catholic party.</p>

<p>The trained bands of the town were called out to meet the danger, and
they consisted entirely of Protestants. But they also were agitated by
uncertainty about the intentions of their new sovereign. What the
Catholics wished and demanded, the free exercise of their religion, the
Protestants just as strongly held to be inadmissible and dangerous.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Privy Council had met at Richmond, where they were joined
by the lords who were in town. Some points of great importance were
mooted&mdash;whether the Privy Council had still any authority, even after
the death of the sovereign from whom their commission proceeded&mdash;whether
this authority was not entirely transferred to the lords as the
hereditary councillors of the crown. The question was probably raised
whether conditions should not be prescribed beforehand to the King of
Scotland with regard to his government. But the prevailing ferment did
not allow time for the discussion of these questions. On the same day
(March 24) the heralds proclaimed James king under the combined titles
of King of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland.</p>

<p>It could not be perceived that the pomp of this proclamation produced
any extraordinary impression. No mourning for the death of the Queen was
exhibited; still less joy at the accession of James: all other interests
were absorbed by the anticipation of coming events. The tone of feeling
first became decided some days afterwards, when a declaration from the
new King was published, wherein he promised the maintenance of religion
on its present footing, and the exclusion of every other form of
it.<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a>
On this the Protestants were quieted; the Catholics shewed
themselves discouraged and exasperated. Yet the heads of the party who
were held in custody were released on bail, and assured by the King's
agents, that if even they were not permitted to worship
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
in public, they should not have to fear either compulsion or persecution.</p>

<p>No movement was made against the acknowledgment of King James, although
this was contrary to the old arrangements recognised by Parliament. But
no one was forthcoming who could have enforced rights based upon these.
The aged Hertford came forward to sign the proclamation of the lords
both for himself, and in the name of his son who represented the
Suffolks. The Lady Arabella made a declaration that she desired no other
position than that which the present King might allow her. The Privy
Council besought King James,&mdash;according to its own expression 'falling
at his feet with deep humility,'&mdash;to come and breathe new life into the
kingdom of England that had been bereaved of its head.</p>

<p>We must not stay to discuss incidental questions, e.g. how the first
news reached James, and how he received it. He remained quiet until he
had obtained sure intelligence, and then without delay prepared to take
possession of the throne, to which his mother's ambition and his own had
for so many years been directed. Once more he addressed the people of
Edinburgh assembled in the great church after the sermon. He would not
admit the statement which had occurred in the discourse, that Scotland
would mourn for his departure; for he was going, as he said, only from
one part of the island to the other: from Edinburgh it was hardly
further to London than to Inverness. He intended to return often; to
remove pernicious abuses in both countries; to provide for peace and
prosperity; to unite the two countries to one another. One of them had
wealth, the other had a superabundance of men: the one country could
help the other. He added in conclusion that he had expected to need
their weapons: that he now required only their hearts.</p>

<p>What filled his soul with pride and the consciousness of a high calling,
was the thought that he would now carry into effect what the Romans, and
in later times the Anglo-Saxon and Plantagenet kings, and last of all
the Tudors, had sought to achieve by force of arms or by policy, but
ever in vain&mdash;the union of the whole island under one rule, like that
which native legendary lore ascribed to the mythical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
Arthur. When he came to Berwick, around which town the two nations had engaged in so
many bloody frays, he gave utterance, so it is said, to his intention of
being King not of the one or of the other country but of both united,
and of assuming the name of King of Great
Britain.<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a></p>

<p>At York he met his predecessor's Secretary of State, Robert Cecil. As no
one knew the relations into which he had already entered with Cecil,
every one was astonished at the kind reception which he accorded to him.
That did not prevent him however from being just to the other side as
well. He greeted the youthful Essex as the son of the most renowned
cavalier whom the realm of England had possessed; he appointed him to be
the companion of the Prince of Wales, and made him carry the bared sword
before him at his entrance into some of the towns. Southampton and
Neville were received into favour; the Earl of Westmoreland was placed
in the Privy Council. He gave it to be understood that he would again
raise to their former station the great men of the kingdom, who up to
this time, as he said, had not been treated according to their merits.</p>

<p>In order to begin the work of union at once in the highest place, he
added some Scottish members to the Privy Council, and placed Scots side
by side with the Secretary of State and Treasurer of England. The Keeper
of the Privy Seal was raised to the Lord Chancellorship, but obliged to
resign the post of Master of the Rolls, which fell to the share of a
Scot, who however contented himself with drawing the income without
discharging the duties of the office. The main feature of the condition
of affairs which now grew up was the understanding between Cecil and
those Scots who were most influential with the King. These were the
leaders of the two parties, one of which hitherto had rather inclined to
Spain and the other to France, Lennox and Mar, and especially the most
active, perhaps the cleverest man of all, George Hume. These were
consulted on affairs of importance.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
The Scots had the advantage, to
which custom almost gave them a right, of seeing the King as often as
they wished: but Cecil and his English friends, in consequence of their
knowledge and practice in business, had the chief management of affairs
in their hands.</p>

<p>The times were gloomy owing to the prevalence of an infectious disease;
still extraordinary numbers of the English nobility thronged to London,
in order to see the King, who took up his residence at Greenwich. It is
computed that there were 10,000 people at court. James felt infinitely
happy amidst the homage which clergy and laity vied with one another in
rendering him. </p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class='centersm'><a name="BIV_II" id="BIV_II"></a>
FIRST MEASURES OF THE NEW REIGN.</p>

<p>How often in former times, when England was in the midst of great and
glorious undertakings, had the Scots, who feared lest they themselves
should be subjected to the power of their neighbours, taken the side of
the enemy and obstructed the victory! Even the last wars might have
taken quite a different course had Scotland made common cause with
Spain. It was this connexion between the two kingdoms which made union
with Scotland a political necessity for England. Ralegh describes this
union under the present circumstances as no less fortunate for England
than the blending of the Red and White Rose had been, as the most
advantageous of all the means of growth which were open to her.</p>

<p>The kingdom of Scotland, like that of England, had extended the
supremacy of the Teutonic over the Keltic races, for these two elements
formed the main constituents of both kingdoms. The German in conflict
with the Keltic race had developed its character and energy.</p>

<p>The Orkney Islands, to which Scotland asserted its claim even against
the kindred race of the Norwegians, and the Hebrides, which were reputed
the home of warriors of extraordinary bravery, were now united in one
kingdom with the Channel Islands, which still remained in the possession
of England from the days of the old connexion between the Normans of
Normandy and that country. The Gael of Scotland, the Gwythel of
Erin&mdash;and the Irish still appear in most records as savages&mdash;the Cymry
of Wales and their Cornish kinsmen, who still spoke their old language,
now appeared as subjects of the same sceptre.
<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1603.</span>
The accession of James to the throne exercised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
an immediate influence on Ireland. Tyrone, the
O'Neil, threw aside the agreement which the Queen's ministers had
concluded with him against their will, thinking that he no longer
required it, since the right heir had ascended the throne. The people
seemed willing to espouse the cause of the new King as that of the
native head of their race, and a genealogy was concocted in which his
descent was traced to the old Milesian kings. The whole circuit of the
British Isles was united under the name of Stuart. As a hundred years
before the last great province of France had been gradually united to
the French crown, and even within human memory Portugal, like the other
provinces of the Spanish peninsula, had been added to the crown of
Spain, so now a united Britain was formed side by side with these two
great powers. James himself noticed the resemblance, and a proud feeling
of self-confidence filled his breast, when he reflected that the change
had been made without the help of arms, as if by the force of the
internal necessity of things. Just as formerly the claim to universal
supremacy together with the spread of the Church had greatly increased
the importance of the Papacy, so now the claim to hereditary right
possessed by James seemed to him of immeasurable value, for by it he had
won so great and coveted a prize: it appeared to him the expression of
the will of God.</p>

<p>Surprise might be felt that France, which for several centuries had
exercised a ruling influence on Scotland, and which in this union of the
two crowns might have seen a disadvantage if not a danger for herself,
allowed it to take place without obstruction. This conduct may be
explained principally by the violent opposition which existed between
Henry IV and Spain even after the peace of Vervins, and by the hostile
influence incessantly exercised by that power upon the internal
relations of his kingdom, in the pacification of which he was still
engaged. It would have been dangerous for Henry himself to revive the
hatred between England and Scotland, which could only have redounded to
the advantage of his foes.</p>

<p>James I however did not intend, and could not be expected to occupy
exactly the same position as his predecessor. If
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
he had adopted her views, yet this was a compliance exacted from him by a regard to the
succession: he had felt that it was wrung from him. It is intelligible,
and he did not attempt to disguise the fact, that he felt the death of
Elizabeth to be in some sense his emancipation. He avoided appearing at
her obsequies; every word showed that he did not love to recall her
memory. In London people thought to please him by getting rid of the
likenesses of the glorious Queen, and replacing them by those of his
mother. The first matter which was submitted to him whilst still in
Scotland, and which engaged him on the journey and immediately after his
arrival, was the question whether he should proceed with the war which
Elizabeth had planned; whether in fact he should continue her general
policy. Henry IV sent without delay one of his most distinguished
statesmen, who was moreover a Protestant, Maximilian de Bethune, Duke of
Sully, as Ambassador Extraordinary; and Sully did not neglect to explain
to the King the plan of an alliance between the States of Europe under
the lead of France, that should be able to cope with the Austro-Spanish
power, a plan which Sully had entertained all his life. James gave the
ambassador, as he wished, a private audience in a retired chamber of his
palace at Greenwich, asked many questions, and listened with attention,
for he loved far-reaching schemes; but he was far from intending to
embark on them. As he had reached the throne without arms, so he wished
to maintain himself there by peaceful
means.<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a>
It was natural that
the Queen, who had been excommunicated by the Pope, and had carried on a
war for life and death with the Spanish crown, should have intended to
renew the struggle with all her might: such designs suited her personal
position; but his own was different. Deeply penetrated by the idea of
legitimacy, he even hesitated whether he should support the
Netherlanders, who after all, in his judgment, were only rebels. To the
remark that it would be a loss for England herself if the taking of
Ostend, then besieged by the Spaniards, were not prevented, he replied
by asking unconcernedly whether this place had not belonged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
in former times to the Spanish crown, and whether the English trade had not
flourished there for all that. In these first moments of his reign
however the difficulties of his government were already brought into
view, together with the opposition between different tendencies latent
in it. If he was unwilling to continue the policy of his predecessor,
yet he could not absolutely renounce it: there were pledges which he
could not break, interests which he could not neglect. In order to meet
his objections the argument employed by Elizabeth was adduced, that she
supported the Provinces only because the agreements, in virtue of which
they had submitted themselves to the house of Burgundy, had been first
broken by the other
side.<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a>
The King's tone of mind was such that
this argument may well have had an effect upon him. At last he consented
to bestow further assistance, although only indirectly. He conceded that
one half of the sum which Henry IV paid to the States General should be
subtracted from the demands which England had against France, and should
be employed by the Netherlanders in recruiting in the English dominions.
By this expedient he intended to satisfy the terms of the old alliance
between England and the Provinces, and yet not be prevented from coming
to an agreement with Spain.</p>

<p>The ambassador of the Archduke and the Infanta, the Duke of Aremberg,
was already in the country, but he was afflicted with gout and somewhat
averse to transact business in writing; and nothing more than general
assurances of friendship were exchanged. In October 1603 one of the
Spanish envoys, Don Juan de Tassis, Count of Mediana, made his
appearance. Astonishment was created when, on his entrance into the hall
where the assembled Court awaited him, he advanced into the middle of
the room before he uncovered his head. He spoke Spanish; the King
answered in English: an interpreter was required between them, although
<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1604.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
they were both masters of French. But however imperfect their
communications were, they yet came to an understanding. The King and the
ambassador agreed in holding that all grounds for hostility between
Spain and England had disappeared with the death of Queen Elizabeth.</p>

<p>After a fresh and long delay&mdash;for the Spaniards would have preferred to
transfer the conference to some town on the continent&mdash;negotiations were
first seriously undertaken in May 1604, and then after all in England.
The affairs of the Netherlands formed the principal subject of
discussion.</p>

<p>The King of Spain demanded that the King of England should abstain from
assisting his rebellious subjects. The English explained the reason why
the United Netherlanders were not considered rebels. The Spaniards
demanded that the fortresses at least, which the Provinces had formerly
surrendered to the Queen as a security for the repayment of the loan
made by her, should be restored to their lawful owner the King, who
would not fail to repay the money advanced. King James answered that he
was tied by the pledges of the Queen, and that he must maintain his word
and honour.<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a>
The Spaniards on this started the proposal that the
English on their part should break off their traffic with the United
Provinces. The English replied that this would be most injurious to
themselves. In these transactions James was mainly guided by the
consideration that, if he decidedly threw off the Provinces, he would be
giving them over into the hands of France, to the most serious injury of
England, and without advantage to Spain. On this account principally he
thought that he was obliged to maintain his previous relations with
them. The English found a very characteristic reason for peace with
Spain in the wish to restore their old commercial connexion with that
country. The Spaniards were ready to make this concession, but only
within the ancient limits, from which the trade with both the Indies was
excluded. They argued that their government did not allow this even to
all its own subjects; how then could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
foreigners be admitted to a share
in it? Cecil on this remarked that England by its insular position was
adapted for trading with the whole world, and could not possibly allow
these regions to be closed against her; that she already had relations
with countries on which no Spaniard had ever set foot, and that a wide
field for further discoveries was still open. At no price would he allow
his countrymen to be again excluded from America or the East Indies, to
which countries they had just begun to extend their
voyages.<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a></p>

<p>The peace which was at length brought about is remarkable for its
indefiniteness. The English promised that they would not support the
rebellious subjects and enemies of the King of Spain; and it was
arranged that an unrestricted trade should again be opened with all
countries, with which it had been carried on before the war. At the
first glance this looked as if any further alliance with Holland, as
well as the navigation to the Indies, was rendered impossible. The
Venetian envoy once spoke with King James on the subject, who answered
that it would soon be shown that this opinion was erroneous. In fact, as
soon as the first ships returned from the East Indies, preparations were
at once made for a second expedition. The States General were not
interfered with in the enlistment which they had been allowed to begin;
for it was maintained that they could not be included under the term
rebellious subjects. The only difference made was that similar leave to
enlist in the English dominions was granted to the Spaniards also, who
for that purpose resorted especially to Ireland. In this way the peace
exactly expressed the relations into which England was thrown by the
change of government. James, who for his own part would have wished
simply to renew the friendly relations which had formerly existed, found
himself compelled to stipulate for exceptions owing to the form which
the interests of England had now assumed. The Spaniards allowed them,
because even on these terms the termination of the war was of the
greatest advantage to them, and they did not surrender the hope of
changing the peace into a full alliance later on,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
although their proposals to that effect were in the first instance declined.</p>

<p>And notwithstanding any ambiguity which might arise as to the scope of
the treaty with regard to individual questions, the conclusion of peace
was in itself of great importance: it implied a change of policy which
created the greatest stir. It affected the United Provinces and filled
them with anxiety, for in their judgment not only was the action of
Spain against them no longer fettered, but the Spanish ambassador in
England was sure in time by means of gold and intrigues to acquire an
influence which must be fatal to them.</p>

<p>The King thought that he had achieved a great success. His intention was
to be as fully acknowledged by the Catholic powers as by the Protestant;
to occupy a neutral position between those who were favourable, and
those who were opposed, to Spain, and to live in peace with all, without
however losing sight of the interests of England. Men could not be blind
to the correspondence between this policy and the general tendency of
these times. From the epoch of the Absolution of Henry IV and the
overthrow of the League, the separation between religious and political
interests had begun. Men on either side no longer regarded the
ascendancy of Spain as a support or as a danger to religion. The Spanish
government itself under the guidance of the Duke of Lerma acquired a
peaceful character. Thus King James was made happy by seeing embassies
from the Catholic states arrive in England. Not until he stood between
the two parties did he feel himself to be in truth a king, and to
surpass his predecessor.</p>

<p>This sovereign assumed a similar attitude towards the Catholics of
England as well. He could not vouchsafe to them a real toleration; but a
few months after his arrival in England he actually carried out what he
had already promised, an alleviation of those burdens which weighed most
heavily on them. The most grievous was the fine collected every month
from those who refused to take part in the Protestant service. James
declared to an assemblage of leading Catholics, that he would not
enforce this fine so long as they behaved quietly, and did not show
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
contempt towards himself and the State. The Catholics reminded him that
their absence from the service of the Church might be interpreted as
contempt. He assured them that he would not regard it in this light. The
fines, which in late years had amounted to more than £10,000, decreased
in the year 1603 to £300, and in 1604 to £200. The King, like his
predecessor, would not tolerate Jesuits and Seminarists, but he was
content with their banishment; it would have been contrary to his temper
to have had them executed. He sought to avoid all the consequences that
must have been provoked by the hostility of this element which was still
so powerful in the world at large and among his own subjects.</p>

<p>But even within the domain of Protestantism he was now encountered by a
similar problem.</p>

<p>The investigation of the influence which the Scots and English have
exercised on one another in the last few centuries would be a task of
essential importance for the history of intellectual life; for in the
development of the prevailing spirit of the nation the Scots as well as
the English have had a large share. Even under Elizabeth these relations
had begun to exist. The growth of English Puritanism especially, which
had already given the Queen much trouble, must be regarded as but the
dissemination of the forms and ideas that had arisen in the Church of
Scotland. But how much stronger must the action of this cause have
become now that a Scottish king had ascended the English throne! The
union between two populations which so nearly resembled one another in
their original composition, and in the direction taken by their
religious development, could not be a merely territorial union: it must
lead to the closest relation between the spirit of the two peoples.</p>

<p>It was natural from the state of the case, that on the accession of a
Scottish king in England the English clergy who leaned to the Scottish
system should embrace the hope of being emancipated to some extent from
that strict subordination to their bishops which they endured with
reluctance. On the first arrival of James, whilst he was still on his
way to London, they laid before him an address signed by eight hundred
of the clergy, in which they besought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
him, in accordance with God's
word, to lighten the rigour of this jurisdiction and of their condition
in general, and in the first place to allow them to set before him the
feasibility of the alteration. They had nourished the hope that the King
might be prevailed on to reduce the English episcopate to the level of
the Scottish, in the shape in which he had just restored
it.<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a></p>

<p>But the tendencies which the King brought with him out of Scotland ran
in an altogether different direction. He had often been personally
affronted by the Presbyterians: he hated their system; for in his
opinion equality in the Church necessarily led to equality in the State.
His intention was rather by degrees to develop further on the English
model those beginnings of episcopacy which he had introduced into
Scotland. In December 1603 he convened, as the Puritans wished, an
assembly of the Church at Hampton Court, to which he also invited the
leading men among the opponents of uniformity. But he opened the
conference at once with a thanksgiving to Almighty God 'for bringing him
into the promised land where religion was purely professed, where he sat
among grave, learned, and reverend men, not, as before, elsewhere, a
king without state, without honour, without order, where beardless boys
would brave him to his face.' He declared that the government of the
English Church had been approved by manifold blessings from God himself;
and he said that he had not called this assembly in order to make
innovations in the same, but in order to strengthen it by the removal of
some abuses. In the conference which he opened he held the office of
moderator himself. Certainly the suggestions of the Puritans were not
altogether without result. When they expressed the wish to see the
Sunday more strictly observed, to have a trustworthy and faithful
translation of the Bible provided, and to have the Apocrypha excluded
from the canonical scriptures, they met with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
favourable reception;
but the King would neither allow the confessions of faith to be tampered
with, nor the ceremonies which had been brought under discussion to
undergo the least diminution. He thought that they were older than the
Papacy, that the decision of deeper questions of doctrine ought to be
left to the discussion of the Universities, and that the articles of the
faith would only be encumbered by them. And every limitation of
episcopal authority he entirely refused to discuss. The bishops
themselves were amazed at the zeal with which the King espoused the
cause of ecclesiastical jurisdiction, and allowed their justification of
it even on a point of great importance for the constitution, the
imposition of the oath <i>ex officio</i>.<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a>
They even exclaimed that God
had bestowed on them a king, the like of whom had not been seen from the
beginning of the world. It had been the intention and custom of other
princes to limit the jurisdiction of the clergy, and to diminish their
possessions. How much had they suffered from this even under Elizabeth!
On the contrary it was one of the first endeavours of James I to put an
end for ever to these attacks. For as in Scotland the abolition of
bishoprics had been attended with a diminution of the authority of the
crown, he had reason to be deeply convinced of the identity of episcopal
and monarchical interests. In the heat of the conference at Hampton
Court he laid down as his principle, 'No bishop no king.'</p>

<p>But in all this did King James fall in with the spirit of the English
constitution? Did he not rather at this point intrude into it the
sharpness of his Scottish prejudices? The old statesmen of England had
acknowledged the services of the English Puritans in saving the
Protestant confession in the struggle with Catholicism. The Puritans
only wished not to be oppressed. He confounded them altogether with
their Scottish co-religionists with whom he had had to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
contend for the sovereignty of the realm.</p>

<p>In less than two months from the Hampton Court Conference the Book of
Common Prayer was re-issued with some few alterations, with regard to
which the King expressly stated that they were the only alterations
which were to be expected; for that the safety of states consisted in
clinging fast to what had been ordained after good consideration. This
was soon followed by a new collection of ecclesiastical laws, in the
shape which they had taken under the deliberations of Convocation. In
them the royal supremacy was insisted on in the strongest terms, and
that over the whole kingdom, Scotland included. The same competence with
regard to the Church was therein assigned to the King which had belonged
to the pious kings of Judah and to the earliest Christian emperors:
their authority was declared to be second only to that of Heaven.
Henceforward no one was to be ordained without promising to observe the
Book of Common Prayer and to acknowledge the
supremacy.<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a>
And this statute had a retrospective application, even to those who were already
in possession of an ecclesiastical benefice. The King and Archbishop
Bancroft ordered that a short respite should be given to those who were
inclined to acquiesce; but that those who made a decided resistance
should without further ceremony be deprived of their benefices.</p>

<p>On this the whole body of Puritans necessarily became agitated. A number
of clergymen sought out the King at Royston in December 1604. While they
announced to him their decision rather to resign their benefices than to
submit to these ordinances, they called his attention to the danger to
which the souls of the faithful would be subjected by this severity. In
February a petition in favour of those ministers who refused to
subscribe was presented to the King by some of the gentry of
Northamptonshire. He expressed himself about this with great vehemence
at a sitting of the Privy Council. He said that he had from his cradle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
suffered at the hands of these Puritans a persecution which would follow
him to his grave. But in England the tribunals were quite ready to come
to his assistance. In the Star Chamber it was declared a proceeding of
seditious tendency to assail the King with joint petitions in a matter
of religion.</p>

<p>Towards the end of February 1605 the bishops cited the clergy of Puritan
views to appear at St. Paul's in London in order to take the oath. There
were some members of this party who held it lawful to conform to the
Anglican Church because it at least acknowledged the true doctrine.
These had time for reflection given them; the rest who persevered in an
opposition of principle were deprived of their offices without delay.</p>

<p>These proceedings for the first time recalled most vividly to men's
minds the memory of the late Queen. People said that, though she
disliked the Puritans, she had never consented to persecute them on
religious grounds, for that she well knew how much she owed to them in
every other respect. They saw a proof of the King's incapacity in his
departure from her example and pattern. They thought him to blame for
remitting in favour of Catholic recusants the execution of the penal
laws enrolled among the statutes of the realm. And the foreign policy of
the King awakened no less disapproval. It was felt as an injury, that he
had put an end by the peace to the hostilities against Spain, which had
now become even popular. Even the severe edicts issued against the
piracy, which had found support in different quarters, produced in many
places an unfavourable impression. The King was obliged to compensate
the admiral for the losses which he affirmed that he had suffered in
consequence.<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a>
And how much greater were the apprehensions for the
future which were connected with this policy! It was remarked that he
sacrificed the interests of religion and of the country
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
to those of the Catholics and the Catholic powers.</p>

<p>But there was now an organ of political opposition in the country in
which all these hostile feelings found their expression. The resentment
of injured interests, the resistance of the Puritans, and the excitement
of the capital, impressed themselves on the Parliament.</p>

<p>All previous governments had exercised a systematic influence upon the
election of members of the Lower House, and had encroached on their
freedom. When the first elections under King James were about to be held
he declared himself against the exercise of any such influence. He
ordered that the elections should be conducted with freedom and
impartiality, without regard to the bidding of any one and without the
interference of strangers; and that the electors should be allowed to
return the most deserving candidates in each county. He thought that, as
he avoided unpopular measures, men would voluntarily meet his wishes. It
appeared to him sufficient, if, in issuing the writs, he coupled with
them the admonition to avoid all party spirit, and especially to abstain
from electing such as from blind superstition on the one hand, or from
fickleness or restlessness on the other, wished to disturb the
uniformity of religion.<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a>
But in politics personal gratitude is only
a feeble motive. The elections followed the current of opinion which had
been set in motion by the Hampton Court Conference. In the very first
Parliament of King James many Puritans obtained entrance into the House:
the new line which this Parliament struck out influenced the whole
subsequent period.</p>

<p>The speech with which King James opened the session on the 19th of March
1604, immediately before the conclusion of the first year of his reign,
has been often and often reproduced. It is full of the ideas with which
his mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
was principally occupied, of the union of both kingdoms in one
great whole, and of the establishment of religious uniformity. He
thought that in neither of the two kingdoms ought the memory of their
special privileges to be kept alive, for they were pure monarchies from
the first: no privilege could separate them from their head. He
explicitly called the Puritans an ochlocratic sect.</p>

<p>It is extraordinary that, while he sought to win men's affections, it
was his fortune to use expressions which were sure to provoke the
strongest religious and political antipathies.</p>

<p>Parliament acknowledged his succession to be rightful and lawful, and
granted to him, as to his predecessors, tonnage and poundage, i.e. the
right of levying customs, for his life: it arranged according to his
wishes for the withdrawal of many sentences which had been pronounced
against his interest; but in other matters it offered him from the very
first persistent opposition. Contrary to what might have been expected,
the first point concerned the validity of the elections.</p>

<p>In Buckinghamshire the King's officers had annulled an election on the
ground of illegality, and had held a second. The Lower House found that
this was improper, on the ground that the right of deciding in matters
concerning the election of representatives belonged from ancient times
to the House of Commons alone. They declined to confer on this subject
with the Privy Council, or with the Upper House. Ill-will and jealousy
were excited against those of higher rank who had wished to bring one of
their own party into the House of Commons, and the tempers of the
members seemed to be becoming no little inflamed. At last, by the
personal mediation of the
King,<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a>
the Lower House was induced to
allow both of the elected candidates to be unseated, and a third to be
elected in their place. Even this it agreed to reluctantly; but it was
at least its own resolution, and not the result of official influence:
and the Speaker issued his writ for a new election. One of the foremost
principles of parliamentary life, that the scrutiny of elections
belonged to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
the Parliament alone, was in this manner indubitably
established afresh.</p>

<p>Even his ideas on the union of the two kingdoms, which were nearest to
his heart, were shared by few members of the Lower House; and he was
obliged to raise the question by a new and urgent address. A commission
of both Houses was indeed nominated to deliberate together with the
Scots on the execution of the plan. The commission however was so
numerous, and so large a number was required to be actually present for
the transaction of business, that it was evident beforehand that no
result would be achieved; especially as it was confidently to be
expected that the Scots would appoint just as numerous a commission on
their side.<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a>
And the King was already aware that the opposition
against him was not confined to the Lower House, but in this matter at
least was most widely diffused. The proclamation was already drawn up by
which he intended to declare himself King of Great Britain. The judges
were consulted by the Upper House, but their sentence favoured the view
that this alteration could not take place without disadvantage to the
State.</p>

<p>The grant of a subsidy was most urgently needed by the King, whose purse
had been emptied by the expenses of taking possession and by his
prodigality; but the tone of feeling was so unfavourable that he forbore
to apply for it, as he would not expose himself to a refusal which was
certain beforehand.</p>

<p>A petition in favour of some indulgence for the Puritans was drawn up in
complete opposition to the King's views, although it seems not to have
been carried through or sent in. A rigorous bill against the Jesuits and
recusants on the other hand actually passed through the House. Lord
Montague, who spoke against it, was brought before the House of Lords to
answer for some expressions which he used on that occasion, and which
savoured of Catholic principles.</p>

<p>It is quite clear that the very first Parliament of King James set
itself systematically in opposition to him. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
desired union, clemency
to the Catholics, and punishment of the Puritans; and he required
subsidies: on all these subjects an opposite view prevailed in
Parliament. And the divergence was not confined to single points. The
maintenance of that extended prerogative which had been once
established, had been endured under a sovereign who was a native of the
country, had deserved well of her subjects, and was thoroughly English
in her sentiments. But similar pretensions appeared insufferable in a
king of foreign birth, who pursued ideas that were British rather than
English, or rather who had combined for himself a number of tendencies
arising out of the position in which, grand as it was, he stood alone
among English sovereigns. We perceive that by this time the notion had
been definitely formed of reviving the rights of Parliament which had
fallen into abeyance in the late
reigns.<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a>
Even under the Tudors
Parliament had exercised a very considerable influence, but had more or
less submitted to the ruling powers. Under the new government it thought
of winning back the authority which it had wrung from more than one
Plantagenet, and had possessed under the house of Lancaster. Already
members were heard to assert that the legislative power lay in their
hands; and that, if the King refused to approve the laws for which they
demanded his sanction, they would refuse him the subsidies which he
needed.</p>

<p>And this resolution was strengthened by the ill-feeling which the
treatment of the Puritan ministers excited. The Parliament had been
adjourned from August 1604 until February 1605: but the King feared that
these clergymen, who had been assailed just at that time, might apply to
the Lower House in which so many Puritans had
seats.<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a>
He therefore prorogued it afresh in the hope of getting rid
<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1605.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
of certain persons who
were especially hostile, or of bringing them over to his own side.</p>

<p>Instead of this, new grievances were constantly accumulating. In the
absence of regular subsidies the King helped himself to money by a
voluntary loan, which gave great offence, and in this matter also led
people to contrast the late Queen's conduct with that of James. She had,
so people said, conducted the war in Spain, afforded help to the
Netherlands, and maintained garrisons on the Scottish border, three
measures which had cost her millions; of all this there was no mention
under the present King. On the contrary he had additional revenues from
Scotland; for what reason did he require extraordinary
subsidies?<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a>
Men complained of his movements to and fro in the country, and of the
harshness with which the right of the court to transport and cheap
entertainment on these occasions was enforced; of his hunting, by which
the tillage was injured; most of all, of his intended advancement of the
Customs Duties, for this would damage trade and certainly would benefit
only the great men who were interested in the farming of the Customs.
The King had once thought of dissolving Parliament, but afterwards
renounced the idea. As it was, when Parliament was summoned for November
1605, a stormy session lay before it, owing to the attack made by the
Parliamentary and Puritan party upon the behaviour of the King in
ecclesiastical and political questions, as well as upon the financial
disorder which was gaining ground.</p>

<p>An event intervened which gave an entirely different direction to the
course of affairs. </p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class='centersm'><a name="BIV_III" id="BIV_III"></a>
THE GUNPOWDER PLOT AND ITS CONSEQUENCES.</p>

<p>James I was welcomed, if one may say so, by a conspiracy on his entrance
into England.</p>

<p>Two men of rank, Markham and Brook, who had before held communications
with him, and had cherished bright expectations, but found themselves
passed over in the composition of the new government, now imagined that
they might rise to the highest offices if they could succeed in
detaching the King from those who surrounded him, and in getting him
into their own hands, perhaps within the walls of the Tower or even in
Dover Castle. They conspired for this object with some Catholic priests,
who could not forgive the King for having deceived their expectations of
a declaration of toleration at the commencement of his reign. They
intended to call out so great a number of Catholics ready for action,
that there could be no doubt of the successful issue of a coup-de-main.
A priest was then to receive the Great Seal and above all things to
issue an edict of toleration. We are reminded of the combination under
Essex, when even some Puritans offered their assistance in an
undertaking directed against the government. One of their leaders, Lord
Grey de Wilton, a young man of high spirit and hope, was now induced to
join the plot. But on this occasion the Catholics were the predominant
element. The priests thought that the pretence of the necessity of
supporting the King against the effect of a Puritan rising would best
contribute to set the zealous Catholics in motion; and it is undeniable
that other persons of high rank were also connected with these
intrigues. The principal opponents of Cecil and his friends, whose
hostile influence on Elizabeth had at an earlier
<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1603.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
period been feared by
the minister, were Lord Cobham, the brother of Brook, and Sir Walter
Ralegh. Cobham, who like most others had looked for the overthrow of
Cecil on the accession of the King, fell into an ungovernable fit of
disappointed ambition when Cecil was more strongly confirmed in his
position; and his anger was directed against the King himself, from whom
he now had nothing to expect, and who had brought with him a family
which made the hope of any further alteration appear impossible. He had
let fall the expression in public that the fox and his cubs must be
destroyed at one blow. Negotiations, aiming at the renewal of the Lady
Arabella's claims, had been opened with the ambassador of the Archduke,
who then perhaps felt anxiety lest King James, under the influence of
Cecil, should adhere to the policy of his predecessor. In order to
effect a revolution, Cobham launched into extravagant schemes which
embraced all Europe.</p>

<p>The affair might have been dangerous, if a man of the activity, weight,
and intelligence of Walter Ralegh had taken part in it. Ralegh does not
deny that Cobham had spoken to him on the subject, but he affirms that
he had not heeded the idle words, and had even forgotten them
again:<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a>
and in fact nothing has been brought to light which proves
his complicity, or even his remote participation, in this plot. Still
without doubt he was among the opponents of the government. If it is
true, as people say, that he made an attempt by means of a letter to the
King to procure the fall of Cecil, it is easily conceivable that the
latter and his friends availed themselves of every opportunity to
involve him in the accusation. Ralegh defended himself with so much
courage and vigour, that the listeners who had come wishing to see him
condemned went away with a tenfold stronger desire that he might be
acquitted. He himself did not deny that he might be condemned by the
cruel laws of England: he reminded the King however of a passage in the
old statutes, in which for that very reason mercy and pity were
recommended to him. The accused were all condemned.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
Brook and the priests paid the penalty of death: Markham, Cobham, and Grey were
reprieved when they were already standing on the scaffold&mdash;reprieved
moreover by an autograph mandate of James, which was entirely due to an
unexpected resolution of the King, who wished to shine by showing mercy
as well as by severity. The first of these lived henceforward in exile:
the second continued to live in England, but weighed down by his
disgrace: Grey and Walter Ralegh were imprisoned in the Tower. We shall
meet with Ralegh once more: he never lost sight of the world, nor the
world of him.</p>

<p>This conspiracy which, although wrongly as we have seen, bears the name
of Ralegh, was an attempt to put an end in some way or other to the
government, in the shape in which it had been erected by the union of
English statesmen with the Scottish King. Its movers wished to effect
this object by getting rid either of the statesmen, or even of the King
himself. But on the contrary they only succeeded in establishing the
government so much the more firmly; and it then under the joint
influence of both its components entered on the course which we have
described. But if it was so seriously endangered at its commencement,
its progress also could not be free from hostile attacks. The Puritans
threw themselves into the ranks of the Parliamentary Opposition. The
Catholics were brought into a most singular position.</p>

<p>In public they found themselves far better off under James than they had
been under Elizabeth. Far greater scope was allowed to the local
influence of Catholic magnates in protecting their co-religionists. The
penal laws, which as regards pecuniary payments were virtually
abolished, were moreover no longer vigorously enforced in any other
respect. Not only were the chapels of the Catholic ambassadors in the
capital numerously attended, but in some provinces, especially in Wales,
Catholic sermons were known to be delivered in the open air, and
attended by thousands of
hearers.<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a>
At times the opinion revived that the King was inclined to go
<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1604.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
over to Catholicism. He repudiated the
supposition with some show of indignation. But, as we stated, the Queen
incontestably sympathised with the Papacy. She even refrained from
attending the Anglican service, and formed relations with the Nuncio in
Paris, from whom she received communications and presents. Though Pope
Clement on a former occasion had issued breves which made the obedience
of Catholics to a new government dependent on the profession of
Catholicism by the sovereign, yet these were virtually recalled by a
later issue. When the English ambassador in Paris complained to the
Nuncio there of the above-mentioned participation of Catholic priests in
a conspiracy against the King, the Nuncio laid before him a letter of
the Pope's nephew, Cardinal Aldobrandini, in which he declared it to be
the Pope's pleasure that the Catholics in England should be obedient to
their king, and should pray for
him.<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a>
Thus it exactly fell in with
the King's views to be a Protestant, as was absolutely necessary for his
authority in England and Scotland, and yet at the same time not to have
the Catholics against him, and to be able to reckon the Pope of Rome
among his friends.</p>

<p>It is evident that this state of affairs, as it was inconsistent with
the laws of England, could not be permanently maintained. Even men of
moderate views in other respects disapproved the middle course taken by
the King: for they thought it necessary to concede nothing to the
adherents of the Papacy, if they were to be saved from the necessity of
conceding everything. The Catholics desired a public declaration of
toleration. But this could only have emanated from Parliament: the King
had not the courage, and his ministers had not the wish, to make a
serious proposal to that effect. On the contrary, when the Protestant
spirit of the capital displayed itself so unmistakably in consequence of
the severities with which the Puritans were threatened,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
the King and his Privy Council, while affirming that they were merely executing the
laws, announced their intention of introducing a like severity in the
treatment of the Catholics. James I appeared to feel himself insulted if
any one threw a doubt on his wish to allow the laws to operate in both
directions. And as the Parliament which was so zealously Protestant was
expected to reassemble in the autumn of 1605, the laws against the
Catholics began to be applied without forbearance. A renewed persecution
was first set on foot against the priests, who it is true were not
punished with death, at least in the vicinity of the Court, but were
thrown into prison, where they not infrequently succumbed to the rough
treatment which they had undergone. But even the laity daily suffered
more and more from the violence of the spies who forced their way into
their houses. They complained loudly and bitterly of the insecurity of
their position, which had already gone so far that often no tenants
could be found for their farms; and they considered that the least evil,
for to-day they lost their possessions, to-morrow they would lose their
freedom, and the day after their
life.<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a>
There had now for a long
time been two parties among them, one of which submitted to what was
inevitable, while the other offered a violent resistance. With the fresh
increase of oppression, the latter party obtained the upper hand. They
mocked at the hope, in which men indulged themselves, of a change of
religion on the part of the King, who on the contrary was in their view
an irreclaimable Protestant, and assumed an air of clemency to the
Catholics, only to draw the rein tighter hereafter. A brief from the
Pope exhorted them to acquiesce: but even the Pope could not persuade
them to allow themselves to be sacrificed without further ceremony. Some
of the most resolute once more applied to the Spanish court at this time
as they had done before. But in that quarter not only had peace been
concluded, but the hope of effecting a close alliance with England had
been conceived.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
A deaf ear was turned to all their applications.</p>

<p>While they were thus hard pressed and desperate, the thought of helping
themselves had, if not originated, at least ripened, in the breast of
one or two of the boldest of them. They conceived a plan which in savage
recklessness surpassed anything which was devised in this epoch so full
of conspiracies.</p>

<p>Among the families which sheltered the mission-priests on their arrival
in England, and who were moved by them to throw off their reserve in the
profession of Catholicism, the Treshams and Catesbys were especially
prominent in Northamptonshire. They belonged to the wealthiest and most
important families in that county; and the penal laws had borne upon
them with especial severity. The Winters of Huddington, who also were
very zealous Catholics, were related to them. It is easy to understand,
how the young men who were growing up in this family, such as Thomas
Winter and Robert Catesby, acknowledging no duty to the Protestant
government, retorted the oppression which they experienced from it with
bold resistance and schemes of violence. In these they were joined by
two brothers of the same way of thinking, John and Christopher Wright,
stout and soldier-like men, belonging to a family which came originally
from York. They all participated in the attempt of the Earl of Essex,
for above all things they were eager for the overthrow of the existing
government: and Robert Catesby was set at liberty only on payment of a
heavy fine, which he could hardly raise by the sale of one of the most
productive of the family estates. They were among those who, when Queen
Elizabeth lay on her death-bed, proclaimed most loudly their desire for
a thorough change, and were arrested in
consequence.<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a>
They had expected toleration at least from the new government: as this was not
granted them they set to work at once on new schemes of insurrection.
Christopher Wright was one of those who had invited Philip III to
support the Catholics. When the Con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>stable of Castile came to Flanders
to negotiate the peace, Thomas Winter visited him in order to lay their
wish before him. Though they met with a refusal from him as well as from
his master they found nevertheless a support which was independent of
the approval of individuals. In the archducal Netherlands a combination
of a peculiar kind, favourable to their views, had been formed, in
consequence of the permission to recruit in the British dominions, which
by the terms of the peace had been granted to Spain as well as to the
Netherlands. An English regiment, about fifteen hundred strong, had been
raised, in which the chaplains were all Jesuit fathers; and no officers
were admitted but those who were entirely devoted to them. An English
Jesuit named Baldwin, and a soldier of the same opinions, Owen by name,
were the leading spirits among them. There was here, so to speak, a
school of soldiers side by side with a school of priests, in which every
act of the English government provoked slander, malediction, and schemes
of opposition. Pope Clement was blamed for not threatening James with
excommunication as Elizabeth had formerly been threatened; and the
necessity for violent means of redress was canvassed without disguise.
These views were repeated in congenial circles in Paris and reacted also
upon their friends in England. Robert Catesby had been most active in
the enlistment of the regiment. Christopher Wright on his journey to
Spain was attended by one of the most resolute officers of this
regiment, Guy Fawkes. The latter returned with Winter to England, and
was pointed out by Owen as a man admirably qualified to conduct the
horrible undertaking which was being prepared for execution. It must
remain a question in whose head the thought of proceeding to it at this
moment originated: we only know that Catesby first communicated it to
another, and then with the aid of this comrade to the rest of the band.
To this another member had been added, who was connected, if only in a
remote degree, with one of the most distinguished families among the
English nobility. I refer to Thomas Percy, a kinsman of the Earl of
Northumberland, who through his influence had once received a place in
the court establishment of King James of Scotland, and had then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
been the medium for forming a connexion between this prince and the
Catholics. He was enraged because the assurances which he then thought
that he might make to the Catholics in the name of the King, had not
been fulfilled by the latter. In the spring of 1604, just at the time
when the peace between England and Spain was concluded, by which no
stipulations were made for the Catholics, they met one day in a lonely
house near S. Clement's Inn, and bound themselves by a sacred and solemn
oath to inviolable secrecy. It had been their intention once more to
submit to the assembled Parliament an urgent petition in the name of the
Catholics: but the resolutions of the House had sufficed to convince
them that nothing could be gained by this step. Quite the contrary: it
was apparent that the next session would impose far heavier conditions
on them. An attack on the person of the King, or of his ministers, in
the shape in which it had so often been resolved upon, could not do much
even if it were successful: for the Parliament was always in reserve
with its Protestant majority to establish anti-Catholic statutes, and
the judges to execute them. Catesby now disclosed a plan which
comprehended all their opponents at once. The King himself and his
eldest son, the officers of state and of the court, the lords spiritual
and temporal, the members of the House of Commons, one and all at the
moment when they were collected to reopen Parliament, were to be blown
into the air with gunpowder in the hall where they assembled&mdash;there
where they issued the detested laws were they to be annihilated;
vengeance was to be taken on them at the same time that room was to be
made for another order of things in Church and State.</p>

<p>This project was not altogether new. Already under Elizabeth there had
been a talk of doing again to her what Bothwell had done or attempted to
do to Henry Darnley: but men had perceived even at that time that this
would not conduce to their purpose, and had hit upon a plan of blowing
the Queen and her Parliament into the air together. Henry Garnet, the
superior of the Jesuits, had been consulted on the subject; and he had
declared the enterprise lawful, and had only advised them to spare as
many of the innocent as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
possible in its
execution.<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a>
The scheme which had been started under Elizabeth was resumed under King James,
when men saw that his accession to the throne did not produce the
hoped-for change. On this occasion also scruples were felt on the ground
that many a Catholic would perish at the same time. To a question on the
subject submitted to him without closer description of the case Garnet
answered in the spirit of a mufti delivering his fettah, that if an end
were indubitably a good one, and could be accomplished in no other way,
it was lawful to destroy even some of the innocent with the
guilty.<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a>
Catesby had no compassion even for the innocent: he regarded the lords
generally as only poltroons and atheists, whose place would be better
filled by vigorous men.</p>

<p>Without delay, before the end of December 1604, the conspirators
proceeded to make their preparations. Percy, who was still numbered
among the retainers of the court, hired a house which adjoined the
Houses of Parliament. They were attempting to carry a mine through the
foundation walls of that building&mdash;a design that says more for their
zeal than for their intelligence, and one which could hardly have been
effected&mdash;when a vault immediately under the House of Lords happened to
fall vacant, and, as they were able to hire it, offered them a far
better opportunity for the execution of their scheme. They filled it
with a number of powder-barrels which are said to have contained the
enormous quantity of 9,000 pounds of powder, and they confidently
expected to bring about the great catastrophe with all its horrors on
November 5, 1605, the day which after many changes had been appointed
for the opening of Parliament. Their intention was, as soon as the King
and the Prince of Wales had perished, to gain possession of the younger
prince or of the princess, and to place one or other on the throne, with
<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1605.</span>
a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
regency under a protector during their

All preparations had been made for bringing an effective force into the
field; and its principal leaders were to assemble at Dunchurch in
Warwickshire under pretence of hunting. The English regiment in Flanders
was to be brought over and was to serve as the nucleus of a new force.
There is no doubt that Owen was thoroughly conversant with their plans.
Many other trustworthy people were admitted into the secret, and
supported the project with their money. One of these was sent to Rome in
order to convince the Pope of the necessity of the undertaking and to
move him to resolutions in support of it. On All Saints' Day Father
Garnet interrupted his prayer with a hymn of praise for the deliverance
of the inheritance of the faithful from the generation of the ungodly.</p>

<p>But warnings had already come to the government, especially from Paris,
where the priests of the Jesuit party ventured to express themselves
still more plainly than in London. The warning was conveyed with the
express intimation that 'somewhat is at present in hand among these
desperate hypocrites.'<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a>
What an impression must now have been
produced when one of the Catholic lords, who at an earlier period had
followed this party, but had for some time withdrawn from it, Lord
Mounteagle, communicated to the first minister a letter in which he was
admonished in mysterious language to hold aloof from the opening of
Parliament. It may be that the King, as he himself relates, in
deciphering the sense of a word hit upon the supposition that a fate
similar to that of his father was being prepared for him; or it may be
that the ministers had, as they affirm, come upon the traces of the
matter; but however this may have been, on the evening before the
opening of Parliament the vaults were examined, when not only were the
powder-barrels found among wood and faggots, but also one of the
conspirators, Guy Fawkes, who was busy with the last preparations for
the execution of the plot. With a smiling countenance he confessed his
purpose, which he seemed to regard as the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>fulfilment of a religious
duty. The pedantic monarch thought himself in the presence of a
fanatical Mutius Scaevola.</p>

<p>The rest of the conspirators who were in London, alarmed by the
discovery, hastened to the appointed rendezvous at Dunchurch; but the
news which they brought with them caused general discouragement. With a
band of about one hundred men, they set off to make their escape to
Wales, the home of most of the Catholics, hoping to receive the promised
reinforcements and the support of the population on their way. They once
actually attempted to assure themselves of the latter; but on declaring
that they were for God and the country, they received the answer that
they ought also to be for the King. No one joined them, and many of
their comrades had already dispersed when they were overtaken at
Holbeach by the armed bands of Worcestershire under the Sheriff. Percy
and Catesby, as they stood back to back, were shot dead by two balls
from the same musket; the two Wrights were killed, and Thomas Winter
taken prisoner.<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a></p>

<p>The authority of government triumphed over this most frantic attempt to
break through it, as it had triumphed in every similar case since the
time of Henry VII.</p>

<p>It was perhaps the most remarkable feature in this last, that it was
directed especially against the Parliament. During the Wars of the
Roses, it had only been necessary to drive the then reigning prince out
of the field, or to chase him away, in order to create a new
parliamentary rule. The attempts against Queen Elizabeth rested on the
hope of producing a similar result by her death: but it was apparent in
her last years that her death would be useless, and the comparatively
free elections after that event returned a Parliament of the same
character as the preceding. Even under the new reign the Protestant
party secured their ascendancy in the elections; and the only
possibility of an alteration for the future was to be found in the
annihilation of the Parliament, not so much of the institution&mdash;at least
this was not mooted&mdash;but of the men
<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1606.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>
who composed it and gave it its
character. The violent attempt on the Parliament is a proof of its
power. The Gunpowder Plot was directed against the King, not in his
personal capacity as monarch, but as head of the legislative authority.
It was felt that this power itself with all its component parts must be
destroyed without scruple or mercy, if an order of things in the State
corresponding to the views of the hierarchical party was ever again to
obtain a footing.</p>

<p>The necessary and inevitable result of the conspiracy was that
Parliament, which did not enter on the session until January 1606, still
further increased the existing severity of its laws. The great body of
Catholics had not in any way participated in the plot; but yet, as it
had originated among them, and was intended for the redress of their
common grievances, they were all affected by the reaction which it
produced. The Catholic recusants were to be subjected to the former
penalties: they were sentenced to exclusion from the palace and from the
capital; they were forbidden to hold any appointment in the public
service either in the administration of justice, or as government
officials, or even as physicians; they were obliged to open their houses
at any moment for examination; the solemnisation of their marriages and
the baptism of their children were henceforth to be legal only if
performed by Protestant clergymen. It is evident that the Papal See
would have preferred to restrain the agitation of the Catholics at this
juncture; but as the latter appealed to the principle which had been
impressed on them by their missionaries, that men had no duties to a
king who was a heretic, the Parliament thought it necessary to impose on
them an oath which concerned the authority of their Church as well as
that of the State. Not only were they to be compelled to acknowledge the
King as their legitimate prince, to defend him against every conspiracy
and every attack, even when made under the pretext of religion, and to
promise to reveal any such to him; they must also renounce the doctrine
that the authority of the Church gave the Pope the right of deposing a
king, and absolving his subjects from their oath of allegiance; and they
must condemn as impious and heretical the doctrine that princes
excommunicated by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>
Pope could be dethroned or put to death by their
subjects.<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a>
Attention was directed to the English regiment in the
service of the Archduke; and it was thought dangerous that so many
malcontents should be assembled there, and should practise the use of
arms, in order perhaps to turn them some day against their country. It
was enacted that the Oath of Supremacy should be imposed on every one
who took service abroad before his departure, with a pledge that he
would not be reconciled to the Papacy: even securities for the
observance of the oath were to be exacted.</p>

<p>In the spring of the year 1605 the whole state of England still showed a
tendency to clemency and conciliation. In the early part of 1606 the
opposite tendency had completely obtained the upper hand.</p>

<p>But this state of affairs necessarily reacted on Catholic countries and
governments. In Spain, where it was easiest to rouse the
susceptibilities of Catholicism, the severe measures of the Parliament
of themselves created a feeling of bitterness: but besides this, Irish
refugees resorted thither who gave an agitating account of the way in
which these measures were carried out in
Ireland:<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a>
so that the nation felt itself affronted in the persons of its co-religionists. Both
governments, that of Spain and that of the Netherlands, refused to hand
over to the English government men like Baldwin and Owen, who were taxed
with participating in the plot, or to banish others whom the English
government considered dangerous. The pious were reminded of the will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
of Queen Mary, in which she had transferred her hereditary right over
England, France, Ireland and Scotland, to the House of Spain in case her
son should not be converted to the Church.</p>

<p>And how deeply must the Court of Rome have felt itself injured by the
imposition of the Oath of Supremacy. A Pope of the Borghese family had
just been elected, Paul V, who was as deeply convinced of the truth of
the Papal principles, and as firmly resolved to enforce them, as any of
his predecessors; and who was surrounded by learned men and statesmen
who looked upon the maintenance of these principles as the salvation of
the world. Their religious pride was galled to the quick by the
imposition of such an oath as that exacted in England, by which
principles at that time zealously taught in Catholic schools were
described not only as objectionable but as heretical. They thought it
possible that the temporal power might prevail on the English Catholics
to accept this oath, as in fact the archpriest Blackwell who had been
appointed by Clement VIII took it, and advised others to do the same.
But by this act the supremacy of the King would be practically
acknowledged, and the connexion of the English Catholics with the Papacy
dissolved. Moved by these considerations, Paul V, in a brief of
September 1, 1606, declared that the oath contained much that was
contrary to the faith, and could not be taken by any one without damage
to his salvation. He expressed his anticipation that the English
Catholics, whose constancy had been tested like gold in the fire of the
persecutions, would show their firmness on this occasion also, and that
they would rather undergo all tortures, even death itself, than insult
the Divine Majesty. At first the archpriest and the moderate Catholics,
who did not consider that the political claims referred to in the oath
were the true principles of the Papacy, declared that the brief was
spurious; but after some time it was confirmed in all due form, and an
address appeared from the pen of the most eminent apologist of the See
of Rome, Cardinal Bellarmin, in which he reminded the archpriest that
the general apostolical authority of the Pope could not be impugned even
in a single iota of the subtleties of dogma: how much less then in this
instance,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
where the question was simply whether men should look for the
head of the Church in the successor of Henry VIII, or in the successor
of S. Peter.</p>

<p>These statements however greatly irritated the King, both as a man of
learning and as a temporal potentate. He took pen in hand himself in
order to defend the oath, in the wording of which he had a large share.
He expressed his astonishment that so distinguished a scholar as
Bellarmin should confound the Oath of Supremacy with the Oath of
Allegiance, in which no word occurred affecting any article of faith,
and which was only intended to distinguish the champions of an attempt
like the Gunpowder Plot from his quiet subjects of the Catholic
religion. He said that nothing more disastrous to these could have
happened than that the Pope should condemn the oath, and thereby the
original relation of obedience which bound them to their sovereign; for
he was requiring them to repudiate this obedience and to abjure again
the oath which had already been taken by many, after the example of the
archpriest. James I took much trouble to justify the form of oath by the
decrees of the old
councils.<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a></p>

<p>Criminal attempts, even when they fail, have at times the most extensive
political consequences. James I had started with the idea of linking his
subjects of every persuasion to himself in the bonds of a free and
uniform obedience, and of creating harmonious relations between the
rival powers of the world and his own realm of Great Britain. Then
intervened this murderous attempt; and the measures to which he had
recourse in order to secure his person and his country against the
repetition of criminal attacks like this last, rekindled the national
and religious animosities which he desired to lull, and fanned them into
a bright flame. </p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class='centersm'><a name="BIV_IV" id="BIV_IV"></a>
FOREIGN POLICY OF THE NEXT TEN YEARS.</p>

<p>What had already taken place before James ascended the throne, occurred
again under these circumstances. Although belonging to one of the two
religious parties which divided the world between them, he had sought to
form relations with the other, when circumstances which were beyond all
calculation caused and almost compelled him to return to his original
position.</p>

<p>The Republic of Venice enjoyed his full sympathies in the quarrel in
which at this time it became involved with the Papacy. The laws which it
had made for limiting the influence of the clergy appeared to him in the
highest degree just and wise. He thought that Europe would be happy if
other princes as well would open their eyes, for they would not then
experience so many usurpations on the part of the See of Rome; and he
showed himself ready to form an alliance with the Republic. The
Venetians always affirmed that the lively interest of the King of
England in their cause had already, by provoking the jealousy of the
French, strengthened their resolution to arrange these disputes in
conjunction with Spain.<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a>
When the Republic, although compelled to
make some concessions, yet came out of this contest without losing its
independence, it continued to believe that for this result also it was
indebted to King James.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">A.D. 1609.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
In the same way, there can be no serious doubt that the refusal of the
alliance, which the Spaniards had more than once proposed to the King of
England, impelled the former to turn their thoughts to a peaceful
adjustment of their differences with the Netherlands. They had made
similar overtures to France also, but these had been shipwrecked by the
firmness and mistrust of Henry IV. They were convinced however that,
without winning over at least one of these two powers, they would never
even by their strongest efforts again become masters of the Netherlands.
In spite of some advantages which they had obtained on the mainland,
they were so hard pressed by the superiority of the Dutch fleet, that
they at last came forward with more acceptable proposals than they had
before made. The English government advised the States-General to show
compliance on all other points if their independence were acknowledged:
not to stand out even if this were recognised only for a while through a
truce, for in that case they would obtain better conditions on the other
points: and that in regard to these England would protect
them.<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a>
By their conduct to both sides, by standing aloof from the one and by
bestowing good advice on the other, the English thus promoted the
conclusion of the twelve years truce, and thereby procured for the
United Provinces an independent position which they did not allow to be
wrested from them again. The Spaniards attributed the result not so much
to the Provinces themselves as to the two Powers allied with them: they
thought that the articles of the treaty had been drawn up by the former,
but devised and dictated by the latter. It was their serious intention
that this agreement should be only temporary; they reckoned upon the
speedy death of the King of France, and upon future troubles in England,
for an opportunity of resuming the
war.<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a>
But whatever the future
might bring to pass, England, as well as France, derived an incalculable
<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1610.</span>
advantage at the time from the erection of an independent state under
their protection,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
which could not but ally itself with them against the
still dominant power of Spain.</p>

<p>On the whole the general understanding which King James maintained with
Henry IV secured a support for his State, and imparted to himself a
political courage which was otherwise foreign to his nature. The two
sovereigns also made common cause in the Cleves-Juliers question. Two
Protestant princes with the consent of the Estates had taken possession
of it on the strength of their hereditary title. When an Archduke laid
hands on the principal fortress in the country, a general feeling of
jealousy was roused: and even in England it was thought that the point
at issue here was not the possession of a small principality, but the
confirmation of the House of Austria and the Papacy in their already
tottering dominion over these provinces of the Lower Rhine, which might
exercise such an important influence on the State of
Europe.<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a>
When Henry IV joined the German Union and the Dutch for the protection of the
two princes and for the conquest of Juliers, James also decided to
bestow his aid. He took into his own pay 4000 of the troops who were
still in the service of the Republic, sent them a general, and
despatched them to the contested dominions to take part in the struggle.</p>

<p>It does not appear that any one in England was aware of the great
designs which Henry IV connected with this enterprise. When, on the eve
of its execution, he was struck down in the centre of his capital by the
dagger of a fanatic, friends and foes alike were thrilled with the
feeling that the event affected them all, and would have an immeasurable
influence on the world. In England also it was felt as a domestic
calamity. Robert Cecil, now Earl of Salisbury, said in Parliament that
Henry IV had been as it were their advanced guard against conspiracies
of which he had always given the first information: that the first
warning of the Gunpowder Plot must have come from him; that he had as it
were stood in the breach, and that now he had been the first victim. The
crimes of Ravaillac and of Catesby
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
had sprung from the same source.</p>

<p>The enterprise against Juliers was not hindered by this event. The
forces of the Union under the Prince of Anhalt, and the Dutch and
English troops under Maurice of Orange and Edward Cecil, with the
addition of a number of volunteers from such leading families in England
as those of Winchester, Somerset, Rich, Herbert, had already made
considerable progress in the siege when, at last, at the orders of the
widowed Queen, the French also arrived, but in the worst plight and
suffering severely from illness, so that they could not carry out the
intention, with which they came, of sequestrating the place in the
interests of France. When the fortress had been taken it was delivered
to the two princes, who now possessed the whole country. This was an
event of general historical importance, for by this means Brandenburg
first planted its foot on the Rhine, and came into greater prominence in
Europe on this side also. It took place, like the foundation of the
Republic of the Netherlands, with the concurrence of England and France,
and in opposition to Austria and Spain, but at the same time by the help
of the Republic itself and of those members of the Estates of the German
empire who professed the same creed.</p>

<p>The times had gone by when the Spaniards had taken arms as if for the
conquest of the world; but their pretensions remained the same. It was
still their intention, in virtue of the privileges assigned them by the
Pope, to exclude all others from the colonisation of America and from
commerce with the East Indies. They laid claim to Northern Africa
because it had been tributary to the crown of Aragon, to Athens and
Neopatras because they had belonged to the Catalans, to Jerusalem
because it had belonged to the King of Naples, and even to
Constantinople because it had passed by will to Ferdinand II of Aragon
from the last of the Palaeologi. On the strength of the claims made by
the old dukes of Milan they deemed themselves to have a right to the
towns of the Venetian mainland, and to Liguria. Philip III was in their
eyes the true heir of the Maximilian branch of the German house of
<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1611.</span>
Austria: according to their view the succession
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>
in Bohemia and Hungary fell to him. The progress of the Catholic revival afforded them an
opportunity of exercising a profound influence on the German empire,
while the same cause extended their influence over Poland; they obtained
through their commercial relations even the friendship of Protestant
princes and towns in the North. Their intention was now to associate the
two antagonistic powers of the West with their policy by means of
alliances with the reigning families. The first considerable step in
this direction was made after the death of Henry IV, when they succeeded
in concerting with his widow a double marriage, between the young King
of France and an Infanta of Spain, and between the future King of Spain
and a French princess. It was thought certain beforehand that they would
get the conduct of French policy into their hands during the minority of
Louis XIII. But they were already seeking to draw the house of Stuart
also into this alliance in spite of the difference of religion. In
August 1611 the Spanish ambassador, whose overtures had hitherto been
fruitless, came forward to announce that an alliance between the Prince
of Wales and a Spanish infanta would meet with no obstacle on the part
of Spain, if it should be desired on the part of England. It was thought
that the Queen, who found a satisfaction of her ambition in this
brilliant alliance, and the old Spanish and Catholic party, who were
still very numerous in the highest ranks and among the people, might
employ their whole influence in its favour.</p>

<p>But there was still at the head of affairs a man who was resolved to
oppose this design, Robert Cecil, to whom it is generally owing that the
tendencies of Elizabeth's policy lasted on so long into the time of the
Stuarts as they did. I do not know whether the two Cecils can be
reckoned among the great men of England: they would almost seem to have
lacked that independent attitude and that soaring and brilliant genius
which would be requisite for such an eminence; but without doubt few
have had so much influence on its history. Robert Cecil inherited the
employments, the experiences, and the personal connexions of his father
William. He knew how to rid himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>
of all rivals that rose to the
surface<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a>
by counteracting their proceedings in secret or openly,
justifiably or not: enmity and friendship he reciprocated with equal
warmth. He made no change in the method of transacting business which
was conducted by the whole Privy Council; but his natural superiority
and the importance that he gradually acquired always brought the
decision into accordance with his views. The King himself gave
intimations that he did not look upon his predominance as altogether
proper. In one of his letters he jests over the supremacy calmly
exercised by his minister at the centre of affairs, while he, the King,
so soon as his minister summoned him, must hasten in, and yet at last
could do nothing but accept the resolutions which he put into his hands.
A small deformed man, to whom James, as was his wont, gave a jesting
nickname on this account, he yet impressed men by the intelligence which
flashed from his countenance and from every word he spoke; and even his
outward bearing had a certain dignity. His independence was increased by
his enormous wealth, acquired mainly by investments in the Dutch funds,
which at that time returned an extraordinarily high interest. Surrounded
by many who accepted presents, he showed himself inaccessible to such
seductions and incorruptible. At this time he was the oracle of
England.<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a></p>

<p>Among the English youth the wish was constantly reviving that the war
with Spain, in which success was expected without any doubt, might be
renewed with all vigour. Robert Cecil was as little in favour of this as
his father formerly had been. Peaceful relations with Spain were
rendered especially necessary by the condition of Ireland, where Tyrone,
not less dissatisfied with James than he had been with Elizabeth, had
again thrown off his allegiance, and had at last gone abroad to procure
foreign aid for his discontented countrymen. But if Cecil could not
<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1612.</span>break with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>
Spain, yet he would not allow that power to strengthen
itself or to obtain influence over England herself. In regard to the
proposal of marriage that was made he had said that the gallant Prince
of Wales could find blooming roses everywhere and did not need to search
for an olive.</p>

<p>The notion continued to prevail that James I, even if he did not take
arms, ought to put himself at the head of the anti-Spanish party in
Europe, now that Henry IV was no more.</p>

<p>The King and his ministers thought that for maintaining in the first
place the state of affairs established in Cleves and Juliers, an
alliance of the countries which had co-operated in producing it was the
only appropriate means. In March 1612 we find the English ambassador at
the Hague, Sir Ralph Winwood, at Wesel, where a defensive alliance that
had long been mooted between James I and the princes of the Union,
including those of the Palatinate, Brandenburg, Hesse, Wurtemberg,
Baden, and Anhalt, was actually concluded. Both contracting parties
promised one another mutual support against all who should attack them
on account of the Union or of the aid they had given in settling and
maintaining the tenure of Cleves and Juliers. The King was accordingly
pledged to bring 4000 men into the field, and the Princes 2000 as their
contingent, or to pay a sum of money fixed by rule at the choice of the
country which should be
attacked.<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a>
The agreement was concluded for
six years, the period for which it was also agreed that the Union should
still continue. The idea was started, I do not know whether by King
James or rather by the leading English statesmen, of making this
alliance the basis of a general European coalition against the
encroachments of the
Spaniards.<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a>
The German princes invited the
Queen-Regent of France to join it, and to bring the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>
Republic of the United Provinces into it. Mary de' Medici refused, on the ground that
this was unnecessary, as the Republic was sufficiently secured by the
defensive alliance previously concluded; but her ministers at that time
still lent their assistance for the object immediately in view. The
Spaniards had conceived the intention of raising the Archduke Albert to
the imperial throne after the death of the Emperor Rudolph. A portion of
the Electors, among others the Elector of Saxony, which had been
prejudiced by the settlement of Juliers, was in his favour. He possessed
the sympathies of all zealous Catholics; but England and France saw in
the union of the imperial power with the possession of the Spanish
Netherlands a danger for themselves and for the republic founded under
their auspices. They plainly declared to the Spaniards that they would
not permit it, but would set themselves against it with their allies,
that is to say, of course, with the Republic and the
Union.<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a></p>

<p>Little seems to have been heard in Germany of the protest of the powers
in regard to the imperial succession: but it was effectual. The imperial
throne was ascended not by Albert but by Matthias, who had far more
sympathy with the efforts of the Protestants and approved of the Union.
Indeed the Spaniards too, under the guidance of the pacific Lerma, were
not inclined to drive matters to extremities.</p>

<p>In the youthful republic of the Netherlands an estrangement, involving
also a difference of opinion on religious questions, arose at that time
between the Stadtholder and the magistrates of the aristocracy. The
party of the Stadtholder clung to the strict Calvinistic doctrines; the
aristocratic party were in favour of milder and more conciliatory views,
which besides allotted to the temporal power no small influence over the
clergy, as Arminius had maintained in his lectures at Leyden. After his
death a German professor, Conrad Vorstius, had been invited to Holland,
who added to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
the opinions of his predecessor others which deviated
still more widely from Calvinism, and inclined to Socinianism. The world
has always felt astonished that King James took a side in this
controversy, wrote a book against Vorstius, and did not rest till he had
been ejected from his office. In fact learned rivalry was not the only
motive which induced him to take pen in hand: we perceive that the
adherents of Arminius, the supporters of Vorstius, were obnoxious to him
on political grounds also. The leaders of the burgher aristocracy showed
a marked coldness to the interests of England after the conclusion of
the truce, and a leaning to those of France. The King moreover was of
opinion that positive orthodoxy was necessary for maintaining the
conflict with Catholicism, and for upholding a state founded on
religion: and he sent an invitation to the Prince of Orange to unite
with him in this cause. The strict Calvinism of the prince was at the
same time an act of homage to England.</p>

<p>While religious and political affairs were in this state of perplexity,
which extended to the French Reformed Church as well, a marriage was
settled between the Princess Elizabeth of England and the Elector
Palatine, Frederick V.</p>

<p>This young prince, who at that time was still a ward, had the prospect
of succeeding at an unusually early age to a position in which he could
exert an influence on the German empire. By the mother's side he was
grandson of the founder of Dutch independence, William of Orange; his
uncles were the Stadtholder Maurice and the Duke of Bouillon, who might
be considered the head of the Reformed Communion in France, and who had
married another daughter of William. Frederick had spent some years with
the Duke at Sedan. The Duke of Bouillon, like Maurice, took an active
part in various ways in the European politics of that age: these two men
stood at the head of that party on the continent which most zealously
opposed the Papacy and the house of Austria. Bouillon had first directed
the attention of James to the young Frederick, and had painted to him
his good qualities and his great prospects, and, although not without
reserve, had pronounced a match between him and the Princess Elizabeth
desirable,<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a>
as it would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
form a dynastic tie between the
Protestantism of England and that of the continent. The brother of the
Duke of Wurtemberg, Louis Frederick, who then resided in England on
behalf of the Union, still more decidedly advocated the match. He told
the King that he would have in the young count not so much a son-in-law,
as a servant who depended on his nod; and that he would pledge all the
German princes to his interest by this
means.<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a>
After the conclusion
of the alliance at Wesel the Count of Hanau, who was likewise married to
a daughter of William, visited London with two privy councillors of the
Palatinate, in order to bring the matter to an issue: they were to meet
there with the Duke of Bouillon, to whose advice they had been expressly
referred. Another suit for the hand of the Princess was then before the
English court. The Duke of Savoy had made proposals for a double
marriage between his two children and the English prince and princess.
There appeared to be almost a match between Catholic and Protestant
princes to decide which party should bear off 'this pearl,' the Princess
of England. Without doubt religious considerations mainly carried the
day in favour of the German suitor. The Princess displayed great zeal in
behalf of Protestantism; and James said that he would not allow his
daughter to be restricted in the exercise of her religion, not even if
she were to be Queen of the
world.<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a>
On the 16th of May the members
of the Privy Council signed the contract in which the marriage was
agreed upon between 'My Lady Elizabeth,' only daughter of the King, and
the Grand-Master of the Household and Elector of the Holy Roman Empire,
Frederick Count Palatine, and the necessary provisions were made as to
dower and settlements. This may be regarded as the last work of Robert
Cecil: he died a few days after. The pulpits had attacked the marriage
of the princess with a Catholic, and had exhorted the people to pray for
her marriage with a Protestant. The common feeling of Protestants was
gratified
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
when this result came to pass.</p>

<p>The question of the future marriage of Henry Frederick Prince of Wales
was treated in a kindred spirit though not exactly in the same way.</p>

<p>All eyes were already directed to this young prince and his future
prospects. He was serious and reserved; a man of few words, sound
judgment, and lofty ideas; and he gave signs of an ambitious desire to
rival his most famous predecessors on the
throne.<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a>
He understood the
calling of sovereign in a different sense from his father. On one
occasion when his father set his younger brother before him as a model
of industry in the pursuit of science, he replied that he would make a
very good archbishop of Canterbury. For one who was to wear the crown
skill in arms and knowledge of seamanship seemed to him indispensable;
he made it his most zealous study to acquire both the one and the other.
His intention undoubtedly was to make every provision for the great war
against the Spanish monarchy which was anticipated. He wished to escort
his sister to Germany in order to form a personal acquaintance with the
princes of the Union, whom he regarded as his natural allies. These
views could not have been thwarted if the proposal of the Duke of Savoy,
which had been rejected in behalf of the Princess, had been accepted in
behalf of the Prince.<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a>
For every day the Duke separated himself more
and more from the policy of Spain: he had even wished at one time to be
admitted into the Union. He offered a large portion with the hand of his
daughter, and was ready to agree to those restrictions in the exercise
of her religion which it might be thought necessary to prescribe.
Meanwhile, however, another project came up. The grandees of France
wished to bring a prince of such high endowments and decided views into
the closest relations with the house of Bourbon, in order to oppose the
action of Spain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>
on the French court by another influence. They made
proposals for a marriage between the Prince of Wales and the second
daughter of Henry IV, the Lady Christine of France. They found the most
cordial reception for this scheme among the English who favoured
Protestantism, and understood the course of the world. It was thought
that the new League, for this was the designation given to the
increasing preponderance of Spanish and Catholic views in France, would
by this means be thrown into confusion in its own camp; the French
government would be brought back to its old attitude of hostility
towards Spain, and would only thus be completely sure of the States
General, which could never separate themselves both from England and
France at the same time. The Prince embraced the notion that the
Princess must immediately be brought to England to be instructed in the
Protestant faith, and perhaps to be converted to it. As she was still
very young his notion was so far reasonable, although in other respects
her age was a considerable obstacle. While he referred the decision to
his father, he yet made a remark which shows his own leanings, that this
marriage would certainly be most acceptable to all his brother
Protestants.<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a>
What a prospect would have dawned on these if a young
and energetic king of England, confederate with Germany and Holland, and
looked up to in France for a double reason, both on account of the old
and still unforgotten
claims,<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a>
and on account of his marriage, had
taken the Huguenots under his protection or actually appealed to them in
his own behalf!</p>

<p>The 5th of November 1612 was fixed as the day on which the question was
to be decided by a commission expressly appointed for this purpose. King
James, who is represented as favourable to the connexion with France,
went from Theobald's to the meeting: the Prince had drawn out for
himself the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
arguments by which he thought to refute the objections of
opponents. On the very same day he was taken ill, and was obliged to ask
for an adjournment; but from day to day and hour to hour his illness
became more dangerous. He exhibited a composed and, when addressed on
religious questions, a devout frame of mind, but he did not wish to die.
When some one said to him that God only could heal him, he replied that
perhaps the physicians also might do something. On the 17th of November,
two hours after midnight, he died&mdash;'the flower of his house,' as men
said, 'the palladium of the country, the terror of his foes.' They even
went so far as to put him at this early age on a level with Henry IV,
who had been proved by a life full of struggles and vicissitudes. The
comparison rested on the circumstance that the young and highly-gifted
prince was forced to succumb to an unexpected misfortune while preparing
for great undertakings which, like those of Henry IV, were to be
directed against Spain.</p>

<p>It is very probable that this prince, if he had lived to ascend the
English throne, would have attempted to give to affairs a turn suitable
to the vigorous designs which engrossed his thoughts. According to all
appearance he would not have trodden in the footsteps of his father. He
appeared quite capable of reviving the old plans of conquest entertained
by the house of Lancaster: he would have united outspoken Protestant
tendencies with the monarchical views of Edward VI, or rather of
Elizabeth. With the men who then held the chief power in England he had
no points of agreement, and they already feared
him.<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a>
They were even accused of having caused his premature death.</p>

<p>Yet the course which had been struck out with the co-operation of the
young prince was not abandoned at his death.</p>

<p>The Elector Palatine had already arrived in London. His demeanour and
behaviour quieted the doubts of one party and put to shame the
predictions of the other: he appeared manly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>
firm, bent on high aims, and dignified: he knew how to win over even the Queen who at first was
unfavourable to him. Letters exchanged at that time are full of the joy
with which the marriage was welcomed by the Protestants. But it was just
as decidedly unwelcome to the other party. An expression which was then
reported in Brussels shewed how lively the hatred was, and how widely
and how far into the future political combinations extended. It was said
that this marriage was designed to wrest the Imperial throne from the
house of Austria; but it was added, with haughty reliance on the
strength of Catholic Europe, that this design should never
succeed.<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a></p>

<p>Another collision seemed at times to be immediately impending. In the
year 1613 the English government sent to ask the districts most exposed
to a Spanish invasion, how many troops they could severally oppose to
it, and had appointed the fire signals which were to announce the coming
danger. It is indeed not wonderful that under such circumstances it
continued the policy which was calculated to promote a general European
opposition to the Spaniards.</p>

<p>When the French grandees though fit to contest the Spanish marriages
which Mary de' Medici made up, they had King James on their side, who
regarded it as the natural right of princes of the blood to undertake
the charge of public affairs during a minority. At the meeting of the
Estates in 1614, it was their intention to get the government into their
hands, and then to bring it back again to the line of policy of Henry
IV. The English ambassador, Edmonds, showed that he concurred with them.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards the differences between the Duke of Savoy and the
Spanish governor in Milan terminated in an open rupture. The French
grandees, though they had not carried their point in the States-General,
yet showed themselves independent and strong enough to follow their own
wishes in interfering in this matter. While the Queen-Regent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>
supported the Spaniards, they came to the assistance of the Duke. In this struggle
King James also came forward on his side in concert with the Republic of
Venice, which was still able to throw a considerable weight into the
scale on an Italian question.</p>

<p>The cause of Savoy appeared the common cause of opposition to Spain.
James deemed himself happy in being able to do something further for
that object by removing the misunderstanding which existed between
Protestant Switzerland and the Duke. On his own side he carefully upheld
the old connexion between England and the Cantons. He gave out that in
this manner the territories of his allies would extend to the very
borders of Italy, for Protestant Switzerland formed the connecting link
between his friends in that country and the German Union which, in turn,
bordered on the Netherlands.</p>

<p>With the same view, in order that his allies might not have their hands
tied elsewhere, he laboured to remove the dissensions between Saxony and
Brandenburg, and between the States-General and Denmark. At the repeated
request of certain German princes, he made it his business to put an
end, by his intervention, to the war that had broken out between Sweden
and Denmark. By the mediation of his ambassadors the agreement of Knäröd
was arrived at, which regulated the relations between the Northern
kingdoms for a considerable time. James saw his name at the head of an
agreement which settled the rights of sovereignty in the extreme North
'from Tittisfiord to Weranger,' and had the satisfaction of finding that
the ratification of this agreement by his own hand was deemed
necessary.<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a>
A general union of the Protestant kingdoms and states
was contemplated in this arrangement.</p>

<p>In connexion with this, the commercial relations that had been long ago
concluded with Russia assumed a political character. During the quarrels
about the succession to the throne, when Moscow was in danger of falling
under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>
dominion of Poland, which in this matter was supported by
Catholic Europe, the Russians sought the help of Germany, of the
Netherlands, and especially of England. We learn that the house of
Romanoff offered to put itself in a position of inferiority to King
James, who appeared as the supreme head of the Protestant world, if he
would free Russia from the invasion of the Poles.</p>

<p>Already in the time of Elizabeth the opposition to the Spanish monarchy
had caused the English government to make advances to the Turks.</p>

<p>Just at the period when the fiercest struggle was preparing, at the time
when Philip II was making preparations for annexing Portugal, the Queen
determined to shut her eyes to the scruples which hitherto had generally
deterred Christian princes from entering into an alliance with
unbelievers. It is worth noticing that from the beginning East Indian
interests were the means of drawing these powers nearer to one another.
Elizabeth directed the attention of the Turks to the serious obstacles
that would be thrown in their way, if the Portuguese colonies in that
quarter were conquered by the far more powerful
Spaniards.<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a>
The commercial relations between the two kingdoms themselves presented
another obvious consideration. England seized the first opportunity for
throwing off the protection of the French flag, which had hitherto
sheltered her, and in a short time was much rather able to protect the
Dutch who were still closely allied with her. The Turks greatly desired
to form a connexion with a naval power independent of the religious
impulses which threatened to bring the neighbouring powers of the West
into the field against them. They knew that the English would never
co-operate against them with Spaniards and French. Political and
commercial interests were thus intertwined with one another. A Levant
company was founded, at the proposal of which the ambassadors were
nominated, both of whom enjoyed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>
a considerable influence under James I.</p>

<p>As in these transactions attention was principally directed to the
commerce in the products of the East Indies carried on through the
medium of Turkish harbours, was it not to be expected that an attempt
should be made to open direct communication with that country? The Dutch
had already anticipated the English in that quarter; but Elizabeth was
for a long time withheld by anxiety lest the negotiations for peace with
Spain, which were just about to be opened, should be interrupted by such
an enterprise. Yet under her government the company was formed for
trading with the East Indies, to which, among other exceptional
privileges, the right of acquiring territory was granted. It was only
bound to hold aloof from those provinces which were in the possession of
Christian sovereigns. We have seen how carefully in the peace which
James I concluded with Spain everything was avoided which could have
interrupted this commerce. James confirmed this company by a charter
which was not limited to any particular time. And in the very first
contracts which this company concluded with the great Mogul, Jehangir,
they had the right bestowed on them of fortifying the principal
factories which were made over to them. The native powers regarded the
English as their allies against the Spaniards and Portuguese.</p>

<p>In the year 1612 Shirley, a former friend of Essex, who had been induced
by the Earl himself to go to the East, and who had there formed a close
alliance with Shah Abbas, returned to England, where he appeared wearing
a turban and accompanied by a Persian wife. He entrusted the child of
this marriage to the guardianship of the Queen, when he again set off
for Persia, in order to open up the commerce of England in the Persian
Gulf.</p>

<p>But it was a still more important matter that the attempts which had
been made under the Queen to set foot permanently on the other
hemisphere could now be brought to a successful issue under King James.
It may perhaps be affirmed that, so long as the countries were at open
war, these attempts could not have been made, unless Spain had first
been completely conquered. England could not resume her old designs
until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>
a peace had been concluded, which, if it did not expressly allow
new settlements, yet did not expressly forbid them, but rather perhaps
tacitly reserved the right of forming them. Under the impulse which the
discovery of the Gunpowder Plot gave, I will not say to war, but
certainly to continued opposition to Spain, the King bestowed on the
companies formed for that purpose the charters on which the colonisation
of North America was founded. The settlement of Virginia was again
undertaken, and, although in constant danger of destruction from the
opposition of warlike natives and the dissensions of its founders, yet
at last by the union of strict law and personal energy it was quickened
into life, and kindled the jealousy of the Spaniards. They feared
especially that it would throw obstacles in the way of the homeward and
outward voyages of their
fleets.<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a>
Their hands, however, were tied by
the peace: and we learn that when they made overtures for the marriage
of the Prince of Wales with a Spanish Infanta, they proposed at the same
time that this colony should be given up. But the Prince of Wales from
the interest which he took in all maritime enterprises was just the man
to exert himself most warmly in its behalf. Under his auspices a new
expedition was equipped, which did not sail till after his death, and
then materially contributed to secure the colony. Not without good
reason have the colonists commemorated his name.</p>

<p>How immensely important at least for England have her relations with the
Spanish monarchy been shown to be! She had been formerly its ally, its
attacks she had then withstood, and now resisted it at every turn. Only
in rivalry with this power, and in opposition to it, was the great
Island of the West brought into relations, for which it was suited by
its geographical position, with every part of the known world. </p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class='centersm'><a name="BIV_V" id="BIV_V"></a>
PARLIAMENTS OF 1610 AND 1614.</p>

<p>For the full occupation of this position in the world, and for
maintaining and extending it, nothing was more necessary than internal
harmony in Great Britain, not only between the two kingdoms, but also in
each of them at home. While Robert Cecil procured full recognition for
considerations of foreign policy, he conceived the further design of
bringing about such an unity above all things in England itself, as, if
successful, would have procured for the power of the King an authority
paramount to all the other elements of the constitution.</p>

<p>The greatest standing evil from which the existing government suffered,
was the inequality between income and expenditure; and if the lavish
profusion of the King was partly responsible for this, yet there were
also many other reasons for it. The late Queen had left behind no
inconsiderable weight of debt, occasioned by the cost of the Irish war:
to this were added the expenses of her obsequies, of the coronation, and
of the first arrangements under the new reign. Visits of foreign
princes, the reception and the despatch of great embassies, had caused
still further extraordinary outlay; and the separate
court-establishments of the King, the Queen, and the Prince, made a
constant deficit inevitable. Perpetual embarrassment was the result.</p>

<p>James I expresses himself with a sort of naive ingenuousness in a letter
to the Lords of Council of the year 1607. In this letter he exhorts them
not to present to him any 'sute wherof none of yourselves can guess what
the vallew may prove,' but rather to help him to cut off superfluous
expenses, as far as was consistent with the honour of the kingdom, and
to assist him to new lawful sources of revenue,
<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1610.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>
without throwing an
unjust burden upon the people. 'The only disease and consumption which I
can ever apprehend as likeliest to endanger me, is this eating canker of
want, which being removed I could think myself as happy in all other
respects as any other king or monarch that ever was since the birth of
Christ: in this disease I am the patient, and yee have promised to be
the physicians, and to use the best care uppon me that your witte,
faithfulnes and diligence can reach
unto.'<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a></p>

<p>As Lord Treasurer, Robert Cecil had the task of taking in hand the
conduct of this affair also. He had refused to make disbursements which
he thought improper, but to which the King had notwithstanding allowed
himself to be led away: he would not hear of increasing the revenue by
such means as the sale of offices, a custom which seemed to be at that
time transplanting itself from France into England. He sought to add to
the revenue in the first place by further taxation of the largely
increasing commerce of the country. And as tonnage and poundage had been
once for all granted to the King, he thought it appropriate and
permissible to raise the custom-house duties as an administrative
measure. Soon after the new government had come into power it had
undertaken the rearrangement of the tariff to suit the circumstances of
the time. Cecil, who was confirmed in his purpose by a decision of the
judges to the effect that his conduct was perfectly legal, conferred
with the principal members of the commercial class on the amount and
nature of the increase of
duty.<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a>
The plan which they embraced in
accordance with the views prevalent at the time contemplated that the
burden should principally fall upon foreigners.</p>

<p>The advantages which were obtained by this means were not
inconsiderable. The Custom-House receipts were gradually increased under
King James by one-half; but yet this was a slow process and could not
meet the wants that likewise kept growing. The Lord Treasurer decided to
submit a comprehensive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>
scheme to Parliament, in order to effect a
radical cure of the evil. The importance of the matter will be our
excuse for examining it in detail.</p>

<p>He explained to them that a considerable increase of income (which he
put down at £82,000) was required to cover the regular expenditure, but
that a still greater sum was needed for casual expenses, for which in
the state, as in every household, certainly a quarter of the sum reached
by the regular expenditure was required. He therefore proposed that
£600,000 should be at once granted him for paying off the debt, and that
in future years the royal income should be raised by £200,000.</p>

<p>This request was so comprehensive and so far beyond all precedent, that
it could never have been made without a corresponding offer of
concessions on a large scale. The Earl of Salisbury in his proposal
formally invited the Parliament to adduce the grievances which it had,
and promised in the King's name to redress all such so far as lay in his
power. It is affirmed that his clear-sighted and vigorous speech made a
favourable impression. Parliament in turn acceded to the proposal, and
alleged its most important grievances. They affected both ecclesiastical
and financial interests: among the latter class that which concerned the
Court of Wards is the most important historically.</p>

<p>Of the institutions by which the Normans and Plantagenets held their
feudal state together, none perhaps was more effectual than the right of
guardianship over minors, whose property the kings managed for their own
advantage. They stepped as it were into the rights of fathers; even the
marriage of wards depended on their pleasure. From the time of Henry
VIII a court for the exercise of this jurisdiction and for feudal
tenures generally had existed, which instituted enquiries into the
neglect of prescriptive custom, and punished it. One of the most
important offices was that of President of the Court, which was very
lucrative, and conferred personal influence in various ways. It had been
long filled by Robert Cecil himself.</p>

<p>The Lower House now proposed in the first place that this right and the
machinery created to enforce it,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>
which gave birth to various acts of
despotism, should be abolished. How often had the property of wards been
ruined by those to whom the rights of the state were transferred. The
debts which were chargeable against them were never
paid.<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a>
The Lower House desired that not only the royal prerogatives, but also that the
kindred rights of the great men of the kingdom over their vassals should
cease, and especially that property held on feudal tenures should be
made allodial.</p>

<p>It is evident what great interests were involved in this scheme, which
was thoroughly monarchical, and at the same time was opposed to
feudalism. Its execution would have put an end to the feudal tie which
now had no more vitality, and appeared nothing more than a burden; but
at the same time the crown would have been provided with a regular and
sufficient income, and, what is more, would have been tolerably
independent of the grants of Parliament, so soon as an orderly domestic
system was introduced. We can understand that in bringing this matter to
an issue a minister of monarchical views might see an appropriate
conclusion to a life or rather two lives, his father's and his own,
dedicated to the service of the sovereign. And it appeared that he might
well hope to succeed, as a considerable alleviation was offered at the
same time to the King's subjects as well.</p>

<p>The King reminded them that the feudal prerogative formed one of the
fairest jewels of his crown, that it was an heirloom from his
forefathers which he could not surrender; honour, conscience, and
interest, equally forbade it. The Lower House replied that it would not
dispute about honour and conscience, but as to interest, that might be
arranged. They were ready by formal contract to indemnify the crown for
the loss which it would suffer.<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a></p>

<p>The crown demanded £100,000 as a compensation for the loss it would
suffer; and besides this, the £200,000 before mentioned which it
required for restoring the balance between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span>
income and expenditure. We
need not here reproduce the repulsive spectacle presented by the
abatement of demands on the one side, and the increase of offers on the
other. At last the Lord Treasurer adhered to the demand for £200,000
everything included. He declared that if this was refused the King would
never again make a similar offer. On this at last the Parliament
declared itself ready to grant the sum; but, even then, set up further
conditions about which they could not come to an immediate agreement, so
that their mutual claims were not yet definitively adjusted.</p>

<p>On the contrary these negotiations had by degrees assumed a tone of some
irritation. Parliament found that the Earl of Salisbury had acted
unconstitutionally in proposing to raise the scale of duties without its
consent, and would not be content with his reference to the decision of
the judges mentioned above, and to the conferences with the merchants.
He endeavoured at a private interview with some of the leading members
to bring round the opinion to his side: but the House was angry with
those who had been present at it, and their good intentions were called
in question.<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a></p>

<p>The speeches also, with which the King twice interrupted the
proceedings, produced an undesirable effect. He was inclined to meet the
general wishes, without surrendering however any part of his
prerogatives. But at the same time he expressed himself about these in
the exaggerated manner peculiar to him, which was exactly calculated to
arouse contradiction.<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> Whilst he was comparing the royal power to
the divine, he found that the House on one pretext or another refused
even to open a letter which he had addressed to them about the speech of
some member which had displeased him: on the contrary he was obliged to
receive back into favour the very member who had affronted him.
Parliament regarded liberty of speech as the Palladium of its
efficiency; <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span>foreigners were astonished at the recklessness with which
members expressed themselves about the government.</p>

<p>As a rule the investigation of relative rights has an unfavourable
result for those who are in actual possession of authority. The
prerogative which the King exalted so highly presented itself to the
Parliament in an obnoxious aspect. In the debates on the contract the
question was raised, how Sampson's hands could be bound, that is to say,
how the King's prerogative could be so far restricted as to prevent him
from breaking or overstepping the agreement.</p>

<p>During a dispute with the House of Lords the sentiment was uttered, that
the members of the Lower House as representing the Commons ranked higher
than the Lords, each of whom represented only
himself.<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a>
It is easy to see how far this principle might lead.</p>

<p>Even his darling project of combining England and Scotland into a single
kingdom could not be carried out by the King in the successive sessions
of Parliament. One of the leading spirits of the age, Francis Bacon, was
on his side in this matter as in others. When it was objected that it
was no advantage to the English to take the poverty-stricken Scots into
partnership, as for example in commercial affairs, he returned answer,
that merchants might reckon in this way, but no one who rose to great
views: united with Scotland, England would become one of the greatest
monarchies that the world had ever seen; but who did not perceive that a
complete fusion of both elements was needed for this? Security against
the recurrence of the old divisions could not be obtained until this was
effected. Owing to the influence of Bacon, who at that time had become
Solicitor-General, the question of the naturalisation of all those born
in Scotland after James had ascended the English throne, was decided
with but slight opposition, in a sense favourable to the union of the
two kingdoms, by the Lord Chancellor and the Judges. The decision
however was not accepted by Parliament.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>
And when the question was now
raised how far the assent of Parliament was necessary in a case like
this, the adverse declaration of the Lord Chancellor was exactly
calculated to provoke a contest of principle in this matter
also.<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a>
With the advice of the Lord Chancellor and the Council James had
declared himself King of Great Britain, and had expressed the wish that
the names of England and Scotland might be henceforth obliterated; but
his Proclamation was not considered sufficient without the assent of
Parliament; and in this case the judges took the side of the Parliament.
The dynastic ideas with which James had commenced his reign could not
but serve to resuscitate the claim of Parliament to the possession of
the legislative power. At other times the precedents adduced by the Lord
Chancellor in the debate on the 'post-nati' might have controlled their
decision: at the present time they no longer made any impression. The
opposition of political ideas came to the surface in this matter as in
others. The King held the strongly monarchical view that the populations
of both countries were united with one another by the mere fact of their
being both subject to him. To this the Parliament opposed the doctrine
that the two crowns were distinct sovereignties, and that the
legislation of the two countries could not be united. They wished to
fetter the King to the old legal position which they were far more
anxious to contract than to expand.</p>

<p>The consequences must have been incalculable, if the Earl of Salisbury
and the Lord Chancellor had succeeded in carrying out their intentions.
A common government of the two countries would have held in all
important questions a position independent of the two Parliaments, and
the person of the sovereign would have been the ruling centre of this
government. If besides an adequate income had been definitely assigned
to the crown independent of the regularly recurring assent of
Parliament, what would have become of the rights of that body? Not only
would Elizabeth's mode of government have been continued, but the
monarchical<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1613.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>
element which could appeal to various precedents in its own
favour would probably have obtained a complete ascendancy.</p>

<p>But for that very reason these efforts were met by a most decided
opposition. It is plain that these rival pretensions, and the motive
from which they sprang, paved the way for controversies of the most
extensive kind.</p>

<p>The scheme of the contract was as little successful as that of the union
of the two kingdoms. The parties were contented with merely removing the
occasion for an immediate rupture; and after some short prorogations
Parliament was finally dissolved.</p>

<p>The King, who felt himself aggrieved by its whole attitude as well as by
many single expressions, was reluctant to call another. In order to meet
his extraordinary necessities recourse was had to various old devices
and to some new ones; for instance, the creation of a great number of
baronets in 1612, on payment of considerable sums: but notwithstanding
all this, in the year 1613 matters had gone so far, that neither the
ambassadors to foreign courts, nor even the troops which were maintained
could be paid. In the garrison of Brill a mutiny had arisen on this
account; the strongholds on the coast and the fortifications on the
adjacent islands went to ruin. For this as well as for other reasons the
death of the Earl of Salisbury was a misfortune. The man on whom James I
next bestowed his principal confidence, Robert Carr, then Lord
Rochester, later Earl of Somerset, was already condemned by the popular
voice because he was a Scot, who moreover had no other merit than a
pleasing person, which procured him the favour of the King. The
authority enjoyed by the Howards had already provoked dissatisfaction.
The Prince of Wales had been their decided adversary, and this enmity
was kept up by all his friends. Robert Carr, however, thought it
advisable to win over to his side this powerful family to which he had
at first found himself in opposition. Whether from personal ambition or
from a temper that really mocked at all law and morality he married
Frances Howard, whose union with the Earl of Essex had to be dissolved
for this object.<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a>
<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1614.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>
The old enemies of the Howards, the adherents of
the house of Essex, many of whom had inherited this enmity, now became
the opponents of the favourite and his government. When at last urgent
financial necessities allowed no other alternative, and absolutely
compelled the issue of a summons for a new parliament, the contending
parties seized the opportunity of confronting one another. The creatures
of the government neglected no means of controlling the elections by
their influence; but they were everywhere encountered by the other
party, who were favoured by the increasing dissatisfaction of the
people.</p>

<p>At the opening of Parliament in April 1614, and on two occasions
afterwards, the King addressed the Lower House. Among all the scholastic
distinctions, complaints of the past, and assurances for the future, in
which after his usual fashion he indulges, we can still perceive the
fundamental idea, that if even the subsidies which he required and asked
were granted him, he would notwithstanding agree to no conditions on his
side, and take upon himself no distinct pledges. He was resolved no
longer to play the game of making concessions in order to ask for
something in return, as he had done some years before; he found that far
beneath his dignity. Still less could he consent that all the grievances
that might have arisen should be heaped up and presented to him, for
that would be injurious to the honour of the government. Each one, he
said, might lay before him the grievances which he experienced in his
own town or in his own county; he would then attend to their redress one
by one. In the same way he would deal with each House separately. If he
is reproached with endeavouring to extend his prerogatives he denies the
charge; but he affirms that he cannot allow them to be abridged, but
that, in exercising them, he would behave as well as the best prince
England ever had.<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a>
He has no conception of a relation based on
mutual rights; he acknowledges
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span>
only a relation of confidence and
affection. In return for liberal concessions he promises liberal favour.</p>

<p>This was a view of things resting upon a patriarchal conception of
kingly power, in favour of which analogies might no doubt have been
found in the early state of the kingdoms of the West, but which was now
becoming more and more obsolete. What had still been possible under
Elizabeth, when the sovereign and her Parliament formed one party, was
no longer so now; especially as a man who had attracted universal hatred
stood at the head of affairs. Besides this a dispute was already going
on which we cannot pass over in silence.</p>

<p>It arose upon the same matter which had caused such grave embarrassment
to the Earl of Salisbury, the unlimited exercise of the right of levying
tonnage and poundage entirely at the discretion of the government. It
was affirmed that the Custom-House receipts had increased more than
twentyfold since the commencement of James's reign, and that a great
part of the increased returns was enjoyed by favoured private
individuals. The Lower House demanded first of all an examination into
the right of the government, and declared that without it they would not
proceed to vote any grant.<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a></p>

<p>In the Lower House itself on one occasion a lively debate arose on the
subject. The opinion was advanced on the part of the friends of the
government that, in this respect as in others, a difference existed
between hereditary and elective monarchies, that in the first class,
which included England, the prerogative was far more extensive than in
the latter. Henry Wotton, and Winwood, who had been long employed on
foreign embassies, explained what a great advantage in regard to their
collective revenues other states derived from indirect taxes and
customs. But by this statement they awakened redoubled opposition. They
were told that the raising of these imposts in France had not been
approved by the Estates and was in fact illegal; that the King of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span>
Spain had been forced to atone for the attempt to introduce them into the
Netherlands by the loss of the greater part of the provinces. Thomas
Wentworth especially broke out into violent invectives against the
neighbouring sovereigns, which even called forth remonstrances from the
embassies. He warned the King of England that in his case also similar
measures would lead to his complete
ruin.<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a>
It was not only urged
that England ought not to take example by any foreign country, but the
very distinction drawn between elective and hereditary monarchies
suggested a question whether England after all was so entirely a
hereditary monarchy as was asserted. It was asked if it might not rather
be said that James I, who was one of a number of claimants who had all
equally good rights, owed his accession to a voluntary preference on the
part of the nation, which might be regarded as a sort of election. These
were ideas of unlimited range, and flatly contradicted those which James
had formed on the rights of birth and inheritance. He felt himself
outraged by their expression in the Lower House.</p>

<p>In order to give the force of a general resolution to their assertion,
that in England the prerogative did not include the fixing of the amount
of taxes and customs without the consent of Parliament, the Commons had
made proposals for a conference with the Upper House. But hereupon the
higher clergy declared themselves hostile, not only to their opinion,
but even to the bare project of a conference. Neil, Bishop of Lincoln,
affirmed that the oath taken to the King in itself forbade them to
participate in such a conference; that the matter affected not so much a
branch of the royal prerogative as its very root; that the Lords
moreover would have to listen to seditious speeches, the aim and
intention of which could only be to bring about a division between the
King and his subjects. The Lord Chancellor had asked the judges for
their opinion; but they had declined to give any. The result was that
the Upper House did not accede to the proposal of a conference.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span>
The Commons were greatly irritated at the resistance which was offered
to their first step. They too in conferences which related to other
matters disdained to enter into the subjects brought before them. They
complained loudly of the insulting expressions of the bishop which had
been repeated to them. An exculpatory statement of the Upper House did
not content them; they demanded full satisfaction as in an affair of
honour, and until this had been furnished them they declared themselves
determined to make no progress with any other matter.</p>

<p>The King however on his side now lost patience at this. He considered
that an attack was made on the highest power when the general progress
of business was hindered for the sake of a single question, and he
appointed a day on which this affair of the subsidy must be disposed of.
He said that, if it were not settled, he would dissolve Parliament.</p>

<p>One would not expect such a declaration to change the temper of the
Lower House. Speeches were heard still more violent than those
previously made. The Scots, to whose influence every untoward occurrence
was imputed, were threatened with a repetition of the Sicilian Vespers.
There were other members however who counselled moderation; for it
almost appeared as if the dissolution of this Parliament might be the
dissolution of all parliaments. Commissioners were once more sent to the
King in order to give another turn to the negotiations. The King
declared that he knew full well how far his rights extended, and that he
could not allow his prerogatives to be called in
question.<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a></p>

<p>These passionate ebullitions of feeling against the Scots, although they
referred to matters of a more alarming, but happily of an entirely
different nature, made the King anxious lest the destruction of his
favourites, or even his own ruin, might be required to content his
adversaries. On the 7th of June he dissolved Parliament. He thought
himself entitled to bring up for punishment the loudest and most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span>
reckless speakers, as well as some other noted men from whom these
speakers had received their impulse, for instance Cornwallis, the former
ambassador in Spain. He considered that they had intended to upset the
government: not only had they failed, but they themselves must atone for
the attempt.<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a></p>

<p>The estrangement was not too great to allow the hope of a
reconciliation. It had been represented to the King that he ought not to
be ready to regard financial concessions as a compliance unbecoming to
the crown, for that in these matters he was at no disadvantage as
compared with any person or any foreign power; that on the contrary the
decision always proceeded from himself; that he was the head who cared
for the welfare of the members. It was said that he need by no means
fear that men would make use of his wants to lay fetters on him; that
bonds laid by subjects on their sovereigns were merely cobwebs which he
might tear asunder at any moment. Even Walter Ralegh had stated
this.<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a>
But the King had no inclination, after the Parliament had
repelled his overtures with rude opposition, to expose himself by
summoning a new one to new attacks on his prerogatives as he understood
them. By the voluntary or forced contributions of different
corporations, especially of the clergy and of the great men of the
kingdom, he was placed in a condition to carry on his government in the
ordinary way. Every measure which would have necessitated a great outlay
was avoided.</p>

<p>It is plain however into what a disagreeable position he was thus
brought. His whole method of government was based upon the superiority
of England. He had at that time brought the system of the Church in
Scotland nearer to the English model. The bishops in that country had
even received their consecration from the English. But he had not
effected this without violent acts of usurpation. He had been obliged to
remove his most active opponents out of the country; but even in their
absence they kept up the excitement of men's feelings by their writings.
The Presbyterians saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>
in everything which he succeeded in doing, the
work of cunning on the one side and treachery on the other, and gave
vent to the deepest displeasure at his deviation from their solemn
Covenant with God.</p>

<p>Relying on the right of England, but for the first time inviting
immigrants from Scotland, James undertook the systematic establishment
of colonies in Ireland. The additional strength however which by this
means accrued to the Protestant and Teutonic element entirely
annihilated all leanings which had been shown in his favour at his
accession to the crown, and aroused against him the strongest national
and religious antipathies of the native population in that country.</p>

<p>He then met with this opposition in Parliament which hampered all his
movements. It was foreign to his natural disposition to think of
effecting a radical removal of the misunderstanding that had arisen. On
the contrary he kept adding fresh fuel to it on account of the
deficiencies of his government, which began to impair his former
importance. The immediate consequence was that in foreign affairs he was
no longer able to maintain the position which he had taken up as
vigorously as might have been wished. His allies pressed him incessantly
to bestow help on them: but if even he had wished it, this was no longer
in his power. It was not that Parliament in withholding his supplies had
disapproved of the object which they were intended to serve. On the
contrary the Parliament lamented that this object was not pursued with
sufficient earnestness; but it wished above all to extend its right of
sanction over the whole domain of the public revenues. But the King was
not inclined to treat with Parliament for the supplies of money
required; he feared to incur the necessity of repaying its grants by
concessions which would abridge the ancient rights of his crown. The
centre of gravity of public affairs must lie somewhere or other. The
question was already raised in England whether for the future it was to
be in the power of the King and his ministers, or in the authority of
Parliament. </p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p class='centersm'><a name="BIV_VI" id="BIV_VI"></a>
SURVEY OF THE LITERATURE OF THE EPOCH.</p>

<p>The times in which great political struggles are actually going on are
not the most favourable for production in the fields of literature and
art. These flourish best in the preceding or following ages, during
which the impulse attending those movements begins or continues to be
felt. Just such an epoch was the period of thirty or forty years between
the defeat of the Armada and the outbreak of the Parliamentary troubles,
a period comprising the later years of Queen Elizabeth and the earlier
years of King James I. This was the epoch in which the English nation
attained to a position of influence on the world at large, and in which
at the same time those far-reaching differences about the most important
questions of the inner life of the nation arose. The antagonism of ideas
which stirred men's minds generally could not but reproduce itself in
literature. But we also see other grand products of the age far
transcending the limits of the present struggle. Our survey of the
history will gain in completeness if we cast even but a transient
glance, first at the former and then at the latter class of these
products.</p>

<p>In Scotland the studies connected with classical antiquity were
prosecuted with as much zeal as anywhere else in Europe; not however in
order to imitate its forms in the native idiom, which no one at that
time even in Germany thought of doing, but in order to use it in learned
theological controversies, and to maintain connexion with brother
Protestants of other tongues. S. Andrew's was at one time a centre for
Protestant learning: Poles and Danes, Germans and French visited this
university in order to study under Melville. Even Latin verse was
written with a certain elegance.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span>
A fit monument of these studies and
their direction is to be found in Buchanan's History of Scotland, a work
without value for the earlier period, and full of party spirit in
describing his own, as Buchanan is one of the most violent accusers of
Mary Stuart, but pervaded by that warmth and decision which carry the
reader along with it: at that time it was read all over the world.
Buchanan and Melville were among the champions of popular ideas on the
constitution of states and the relations between sovereign and people.
It cannot be affirmed that classical studies were without influence upon
their views, but the doctrine to which they adhered grew out of a
different root. It rests historically upon the doctrine of the
superiority of the Church, and the councils representing the Church,
over the Papacy, as it was put forth in the fifteenth century at Paris.
A Scottish student there, John Major, made this doctrine his own, and
after his return to his native country, when he himself had obtained a
professorship, he applied it to temporal relations. The positions of the
advocates of the councils affirmed that the Pope, it was true, received
his authority from God, but that he might be again deprived of it in
cases of urgent necessity by the Church, which virtually included the
sum of all authority in itself. In the same way John Major taught that
an original power transmitted from father to son pertained to kings, but
that the fundamental authority resided in the people; so that a king
mischievous to the commonwealth, who showed himself incorrigible, might
be deposed again. His scholars, who took so large a part in the first
disturbances in Scotland, and their scholars in turn, firmly maintained
this doctrine. They differed from their contemporaries the Jesuits, who
considered the monarchy to be an institution set up by the national
will, in ascribing to it a divine right, but they urged that a king
existed for the sake of the people, and that as he was bound by the laws
agreed on by common consent, resistance to him was not only allowed, but
under certain circumstances might even be a duty. We must also remark
the opposite view, which was developed in contradiction to this, but yet
rested on the same foundation. It was admitted that the king, if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>
the people were considered as a whole, existed for their sake, and not the
people for his; but the king, it was said, was at the same time the head
of the people; he possessed superiority over all individuals: there was
no one who could say in any case that the contract between king and
people had been broken: no such general contract existed at all; there
could be no question at all of resistance, much less of deposition, for
how could the members rebel against the head? King James maintained that
the legislative power belonged to the king by divine and human right,
that he exercised it with the participation of his subjects, and always
remained superior to the laws. His position rests on these views, in the
development of which he himself had certainly a great share; he, like
his opponents, had his political and ecclesiastical adherents. In the
Scottish literature of the time both tendencies are embodied in
important historical works; the latter principally in Spottiswood's
Church History, which represents the royalist views and is not without
merit in point of form, so that even at the present day it can be read
with pleasure; the former in contemporary notices of passing events
which were composed in the language and even in the dialect of the
country, and which in many places are the foundation even of Buchanan's
history. They are the most direct expression of national and religious
views, as they found vent in the assemblies of preachers and elders; in
them we feel the life-breath of Presbyterianism. Calderwood and the
younger Melville, who collected everything which came to hand, espoused
the popular ideas; for information on facts and their causes they are
invaluable, although in respect of form they do not rival Spottiswood,
who, like them, employs the language of the country.</p>

<p>It might perhaps be said that it was in Scotland that the two systems
arose which since that time, although in various shapes, have divided
Britain and Europe. In the historians just mentioned we might see the
types of two schools, whose opposite conceptions of universal and
especially of English history, set forth by writers of brilliant
ability, have exercised the greatest influence upon prevailing ideas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span>
In England these ideas certainly gained admission, but they did not make
way at that time. When Richard Hooker expresses the popular ideas as to
the primitive free development of society, this is done principally in
order to point out the extensive authority of the legislative power even
over the clergy, and to defend the ecclesiastical supremacy of the
English crown, which had been established by the enactments of that very
power. The question was mooted how far the sovereign was above the laws.
Many wished to derive these prerogatives from the laws; others rejected
them. Among those who maintained them unconditionally Walter Ralegh
appears, in whose works we find a peculiar deduction of them in the
statement that the sovereign, according to Justinian's phrase, was the
living law: he derives the royal authority from the Divine Will, which
the will of man could only acknowledge. He says in one place that the
sovereign stands in the same relation to the law, as a living man to a
dead body.</p>

<p>What a remarkable work would it have been, had Walter Ralegh himself
recorded the history of his time. But the opposition between parties was
not so outspoken in England as in Scotland; it had not to justify itself
by general principles, to which men could give their adhesion; it
contained too much personal ill-feeling and hatred for any one who was
involved in the strife to have been able to find satisfaction in
expressing himself on this head. The history of the world which Walter
Ralegh had leisure to write in his prison, is an endeavour to put
together the materials of Universal History as they lay before him from
ancient times, and so make them more intelligible. He touches on the
events of his age only in allusions, which excited attention at the
time, but remain obscure to posterity.</p>

<p>In direct opposition to the Scots, especially to Buchanan, Camden, who
wrote in Latin like the former, composed his Annals of the Reign of
Queen Elizabeth. His contemporary, De Thou, borrowed much from Buchanan.
Camden reproaches him with this, partly because in Scotland men preached
atrocious principles with regard to the authority of the people and
their right of keeping their kings in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span>
order. The elder Cecil had
invited him to write the history of the Queen, and had communicated to
him numerous documents for this purpose, which were either in his own
possession or belonged to the national archives. Camden set cautiously
to work, and went slowly on. He has himself depicted the trouble it cost
him to decipher the historical contents of these scattered and dusty
papers. He has certainly not surmounted all the difficulties which stand
in the way of composing a contemporary history. Here and there we find
even in his pages a regard paid to the living, especially to King James
himself, which we would rather see away. But such passages are rare.
Camden's Annals take a high rank among histories of contemporary
transactions. They are of such authenticity in regard to facts, and show
so intimate an acquaintance with causes gathered from trustworthy
information, that we can follow the author, even where we do not possess
the documents to which he refers. His judgments are moderate and at the
same time in all important questions they are decided.</p>

<p>When we read Camden's letters we become acquainted with a circle of
scholars engaged in the severest studies. In his Britannia, which gives
a more complete and instructive picture of the country than any other
work, they all took a lively interest. Their works are clumsy and
old-fashioned, but they breathe a spirit of thoroughness and breadth
which does honour to the age. With what zeal were ecclesiastical
antiquities studied in Cambridge, after Whitaker had pointed the way!
Men sought to weed out what was spurious, and in what was genuine to set
aside the part due to the accidental forms of the time, and to penetrate
to the bottom of the sentiments, the belief, and activity of the
writers. The constitution of the Church naturally led them to devote
special study to the old provincial councils. For the history of the
country they referred to the monuments of Anglo-Saxon times, and began
even in treating of other subjects to bring the original sources to
light. Everywhere men advanced beyond the old limits which had been
drawn by the tradition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span>
of chroniclers and the lack of historical
investigation hitherto shown.</p>

<p>Francis Bacon was attracted by the task of depicting at length a modern
epoch, the history of the Tudors, with the various changes which it
presented and the great results it had introduced, in which he saw the
unity of a connected series of events. Yet he has only treated the
history of the first of that line. He furnishes one of the first
examples of exact investigation of details combined with reflective
treatment of history, and has exercised a controlling influence on the
manner and style of writing English history, especially by the
introduction of considerations of law, which play a great part in his
work. The political points of view which are present to the author are
almost more those of the beginning of the seventeenth than those of the
beginning of the sixteenth century. But these epochs are closely
connected with each other. For what Henry VII established is just what
James I, who loved to connect himself immediately with the former
monarch, wished to continue. Bacon was a staunch defender of the
prerogative.</p>

<p>The dispute which arose between Bacon as a lawyer and Edward Coke
deserves notice.</p>

<p>Coke also has a place in literature. His reports are, even at the
present day, known without his name simply as 'The Reports,' and his
'Institutes' is one of the most learned works which this age produced.
It is rather a collection provided with notes, but is instructive and
suggestive from the variety of and the contrast of its contents. Coke
traced the English laws to the remotest antiquity; he considered them as
the common production of the wisest men of earlier ages, and at the same
time as the great inheritance of the English people, and its best
protection against every kind of tyranny, spiritual or temporal. Even
the old Norman French, in which they were to a great extent composed, he
would not part with, for a peculiar meaning attached itself, in his
view, to every word.</p>

<p>On the other hand Bacon as Attorney-General formed the plan of
comprising the common law in a code, by which a limit should be set to
the caprice of the judges,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>
and the private citizen be better assured of
his rights. He thought of revising the Statute-Book, and wished to erase
everything useless, to remove difficulties, and to bring what was
contradictory into harmony.</p>

<p>Bacon's purpose coincided with the idea of a general system of
legislation entertained by the King: he would have preferred the Roman
law to the statute law of England. Coke was a man devoted to the letter
of the law, and was inclined to offer that resistance to the sovereign
which was implied in a strict adherence to the law as it was. In the
conflict that arose the judges, influenced by his example, appealed to
the laws as they were laid down, according to the verbal meaning of
which they thought themselves bound to decide. Bacon maintained that the
Judges' oath was meant to include obedience to the King also, to whom
application must be made in every matter affecting his prerogative. This
is probably what Queen Elizabeth also thought, and it was the decided
opinion of King James. He made the man who cherished similar views his
Lord Chancellor, and dismissed Coke from his service. Bacon when in
office was responsible for a catastrophe which, as we shall see, not
only ruined himself, but reacted upon the monarchy. The English,
contemporaries and posterity alike, have taken the side of Coke. Yet
Bacon's industry in business is not therefore altogether to be despised.
He urged the King, who was disposed to judge hastily, to take time and
to weigh the reasons of both parties. He gave the judges who went on
circuit through the country the most pertinent advice. The directions
which he drew up for the Court of Chancery have laid the foundations of
the practice of that court, and are still an authority for it. His
scheme of collecting and reforming the English laws still, even at the
present day, appears to statesmen learned in the law to be an
unavoidable necessity; and the opinion is spreading that steps must be
taken in this matter in the direction already pointed out by Bacon.</p>

<p>Bacon was one of the last men who identified the welfare of England with
the development of the monarchical element in the constitution, or at
all events with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span>
the preponderance of the authority of the sovereign
within constitutional limits. The union of the three kingdoms under the
ruling authority of the King appeared to him to contain the foundation
of the future greatness of Britain. With the assertion of the authority
of the sovereign he connected the hope of a reform of the laws of
England, of the establishment of a comprehensive system of colonisation
in Ireland, and of the assimilation of the ecclesiastical and judicial
constitution of Scotland to English customs. He loved the monarchy
because he expected great things from it.</p>

<p>But it cannot be denied that he brought his ideas into a connexion with
his interests, which was fatal to the acceptance of the former. His is
just a case in which we feel relieved when we turn from the disputes of
the day to the free domain of scientific activity, in which his true
life was spent. He has indeed said himself that he was better fitted to
hold a book in his hands than to shine upon the stage of the world. In
his studies he had only science itself and the whole of the world before
his eyes.</p>

<p>The scholastic system founded on Aristotle, the inheritance of centuries
of ecclesiastical supremacy, had been assailed some time before he took
up the subject; and the inductive method which he opposed to that system
was not anything quite new. But the idea of Bacon had the most
comprehensive tendency: it tended to free the thoughts and enquiries of
men of science from the assumptions of a speculative theology which
regulated their spiritual horizon. The most renowned adversaries of
scholasticism he had to encounter in turn, because they covered things
with a new web of words and theories which he could not accept. He
thought to free men from the deceptive notions by which their minds are
prepossessed, from the fascination of words which throw a veil over
things, and of tradition consecrated by great names, and to open to them
the sphere of the certain knowledge of experience. Nature is in his eyes
God's book, which man must study directly for His glory and for the
relief of man's estate; he thought that men must start from sense and
experience, in order that by intercourse with things they might discover
the cause of phenomena.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span>
He would have preferred for his own part to
have been the architect of an universal science, an outline of which he
had already composed; but he possessed the self-restraint to hold back
from this in the first instance, to work at details, and to make
experiments, or, as he once says, to contribute the bricks and stones
which might serve for the great work in the future. He only wanted more
complete devotion and more adequate knowledge for his task. His method
is imperfect, his results are untrustworthy in points of detail; but his
object is grand. He designates the insight for which he labours by the
Heraclitean name of dry light, that is, a light which is obscured by no
partiality and no subordinate aim. He would place the man who possesses
it as it were upon the mountain top, at the foot of which errors chase
one another like clouds. And in his eyes the satisfaction of the mind is
not the only interest at stake, but such discoveries as rouse the
activity of men and promote their welfare. Nature is at the same time
the great storehouse of God: the dominion over nature which men
originally possessed must be restored to them.</p>

<p>In these speculations the philosopher became aware that there was a risk
lest men should imagine that by this means they could also discover the
nature of God. Bacon lays down a complete separation of these two
provinces; for he thinks that men can only attain to second causes, not
to the first cause, which is God; and that the human mind can only cope
with natural things; that divine things on the contrary confuse it. He
will not even investigate the nature of the human soul, for it does not
owe its origin to the productive powers of nature, but to the breath of
God.</p>

<p>It had been from the beginning the tendency of those schools of
philosophy erected on the basis of ancient systems, in which Latin and
Teutonic elements were blended, to transfuse faith with scientific
knowledge; but Bacon renounces this attempt from the beginning. He puts
forward with almost repulsive abruptness the paradoxes which the
Christian must believe: he declares it an Icarian flight to wish to
penetrate these secrets: but so much stronger is the impulse he seeks to
give the human mind in the direction of enquiry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span>
into natural objects.<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a></p>

<p>Among these he ranks the state of human society, to which all his life
long he devoted a careful and searching observation. His Essays are not
at all sceptical, like the French essays, from which he may have
borrowed this appellation: they are thoroughly dogmatic. They consist of
remarks on the relations of life as they then presented themselves,
especially upon the points of contact between private and public life,
and of counsels drawn from the perception of the conflicting qualities
of things. They are extremely instructive for the internal relations of
English society. They show wide observation and calm wisdom, and, like
his philosophical works, are a treasure for the English nation, whose
views of life have been built upon them.</p>

<p>What better legacy can one generation leave to another than the sum of
its experiences which have an importance extending beyond the fleeting
moment, when they are couched in a form which makes them useful for all
time? Herein consists the earthly immortality of the soul.</p>

<p>But another possession of still richer contents and of incomparable
value was secured to the English nation by the development of the drama,
which falls just within this epoch.</p>

<p>In former times there had been theatrical representations in the palaces
of the kings and of great men, in the universities, and among judicial
and civic societies. They formed part of the enjoyments of the Carnival
or contributed to the brilliancy of other festivities; but they did not
come into full existence until Elizabeth allowed them to the people by a
general permission. In earlier times the scholars of the higher schools
or the members of learned fraternities, the artisans in the towns, and
the members of the household of great men and princes, had themselves
conducted the representation. Actors by profession now arose, who
received pay and performed the whole year
round.<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a>
A number of small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span>
theatres grew up which, as they charged but low entrance-fees, attracted
the crowd, and while they influenced it, were influenced by it in turn.
The government could not object to the theatre, as the principal
opposition which it had to fear, that of the Puritans, shut itself out
from exercising any influence over the drama, owing to the aversion of
their party to it. The theatres vied with one another: each sought to
bring out something new, and then to keep it to itself. The authors,
among whom men of distinguished talent were found, were not unfrequently
players as well. All materials from fable and from history, from the
whole range of literature, which had been widely extended by native
productions and by appropriation from foreign sources, were seized, and
by constant elaboration adapted for an appreciative public.</p>

<p>While the town theatres and their productions were thus struggling to
rise in mutual rivalry, the genius of William Shakspeare developed
itself: at that time he was lost among the crowd of rivals, but his fame
has increased from age to age among posterity.</p>

<p>It especially concerns us to notice that he brought on the stage a
number of events taken from English history itself. In the praise which
has been lavishly bestowed on him, of having rendered them with
historical truth, we cannot entirely agree. For who could affirm that
his King John and Henry VIII, his Gloucester and Winchester, or even his
Maid of Orleans, resemble the originals whose names they bear? The
author forms his own conception of the great questions at issue. While
he follows the chronicle as closely as possible, and adopts its
characteristic traits, he yet assigns to each of the personages a part
corresponding to the peculiar view he adopts: he gives life to the
action by introducing motives which the historian cannot find or accept:
characters which stand close together in tradition, as they probably did
in fact, are set apart in his pages, each of them in a separately
developed homogeneous existence of its own: natural human motives, which
elsewhere appe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span>ar only in private life, break the continuity of the
political action, and thus obtain a twofold dramatic influence. But if
deviations from fact are found in individual points, yet the choice of
events to be brought upon the stage shows a deep sense of what is
historically great. These are almost always situations and entanglements
of the most important character: the interference of the spiritual power
in an intestine political quarrel in King John: the sudden fall of a
firmly seated monarchy as soon as ever it departs from the strict path
of right in Richard III: the opposition which a usurping prince, Henry
IV, meets with at the hands of the great vassals who have placed him on
the throne, and which brings him by incessant anxiety and mental labour
to a premature grave: the happy issue of a successful foreign
enterprise, the course of which we follow from the determination to
prepare for it, to the risk of battle and to final victory; and then
again in Henry V and Henry VI, the unhappy position into which a prince
not formed by nature to be a ruler falls between violent contending
parties, until he envies the homely swain who tends his flocks and lets
the years run by in peace: lastly the path of horrible crime which a
king's son not destined for the throne has to tread in order to ascend
it: all these are great elements in the history of states, and are not
only important for England, but are symbolic for all people and their
sovereigns. The poet touches on parliamentary or religions questions
extremely seldom; and it may be observed that in King John the great
movements which led to Magna Charta are as good as left out of sight; on
the contrary he lives and moves among the personal contrasts offered by
the feudal system, and its mutual rights and duties. Bolingbroke's
feeling that though his cousin is King of England yet he is Duke of
Lancaster reveals the conception of these rights in the middle ages. The
speech which Shakspeare puts into the mouth of the Bishop of Carlisle is
applicable to all times. The crown that secures the highest independence
appears to the poet the most desirable of all possessions, but the
honoured gold consumes him who wears it by the restless care which it
brings with it. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span></p>

<p>Shakspeare depicts the popular storms which are wont to accompany a free
constitution in the plots of some of his Roman dramas: of these Plutarch
instead of Holinshed furnishes the basis. He is right in taking them
from a foreign country: for events nearer to his audience would have
roused an interest of a different kind, and yet would not have had so
universal a meaning. What could be more dramatic, for example, and at
the same time more widely applicable than the contrast between the two
speeches, by the first of which Caesar's murder is justified, while by
the second the memory of his services is revived? The conception of
freedom which the first brings to life is set in opposition to the
thought of the virtues and services of the possessor of absolute power,
and thrust by them into the background; but these same feelings are the
deepest and most active in all ages and among all nations.</p>

<p>But the attested traditions of ancient and modern times do not satisfy
the poet in his wish to lay bare the depths of human existence. He takes
us into the cloudy regions of British and Northern antiquity only known
to fable, in which other contrasts between persons and in public affairs
make their appearance. A king comes on the stage who in the plenitude of
enjoyment and power is brought by overhasty confidence in his nearest
kin to the extremest wretchedness into which men can fall. We see the
heir to a throne who, dispossessed of his rights by his own mother and
his father's murderer, is directed by mysterious influences to take
revenge. We have before us a great nobleman, who by atrocious murders
has gained possession of the throne, and is slain in fighting for it:
the poet brings us into immediate proximity with the crime, its
execution, and its recoil: it seems like an inspiration of hell and of
its deceitful prophecies: we wander on the confines of the visible world
and of that other world which lies on the other side, but extends over
into this, where it forms the border-land between conscious sense and
unconscious madness: the abysses of the human breast are opened to view,
in which men are chained down and brought to destruction by powers of
nature that dwell there unknown to them: all questions about existence
and non-existence; about heaven, hell, and earth; about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span> freedom and
necessity, are raised in these struggles for the crown. Even the
tenderest feelings that rivet human souls to one another he loves to
display upon a background of political life. Then we follow him from the
cloudy North into sunny Italy. Shakspeare is one of the intellectual
powers of nature; he takes away the veil by which the inward springs of
action are hidden from the vulgar eye. The extension of the range of
human vision over the mysterious being of things which his works offer
constitutes them a great historical fact.</p>

<p>We do not here enter upon a discussion of Shakspeare's art and
characteristics, of their merits and defects: they were no doubt of a
piece with the needs, habits, and mode of thought of his audience; for
in what case could there be a stronger reciprocal action between an
author and his public, than in that of a young stage depending upon
voluntary support? The very absence of conventional rule made it easier
to put on the stage a drama by which all that is grandest and mightiest
is brought before the eyes as if actually present in that medley of
great and small things which is characteristic of human life. Genius is
an independent gift of God: whether it is allowed to expand or not
depends on the receptivity and taste of its contemporaries.</p>

<p>It is certainly no unimportant circumstance that Shakspeare brought out
King Lear soon after the accession of James I, who, like his
predecessor, loved the theatre; and that Francis Bacon dedicated to the
King his work on the Advancement of Learning in the same year 1605.</p>

<p>Of these two great minds the first bodied forth in imperishable forms
the tradition, the poetry, and the view of the world that belonged to
the past: the second banished from the domain of science the analogies
which they offered, and made a new path for the activity displayed by
succeeding centuries in the conquest of nature, and for a new view of
the world.</p>

<p>Many others laboured side by side with them. The investigation of nature
had already entered on the path indicated by Bacon, and was welcomed
with lively interest, especially among the upper classes. Together wit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>h
Shakspeare the less distinguished poets of the time have always been
remembered. In many other departments works of solid value were written
which laid a foundation for subsequent studies. Their characteristic
feature is the union of the knowledge of particulars, which are grasped
in their individuality, with a scientific effort directed towards the
universal.</p>

<p>These were the days of calm between the storms; halcyon days, as they
have well been named, in which genius had sufficient freedom in
determining its own direction to devote itself with all its strength to
great creations.</p>

<p>As the German spirit at the epoch of the Reformation, so the English
spirit at the beginning of the seventeenth century, took its place among
the rival nationalities which stood apart from one another on the domain
of Western Christendom, and on whose exertions the advance of the human
race depends. </p>

<h2><a name="INT_V" id="INT_V"></a>BOOK V.</h2>

<p class='center'><br />DISPUTES WITH PARLIAMENT DURING THE LATER YEARS OF THE REIGN OF JAMES I
AND THE EARLIER YEARS OF THE REIGN OF CHARLES I. </p>

<p>It has been my wish hitherto in my narrative to suppress myself as it
were, and only to let the events speak and the mighty forces be seen
which, arising out of and strengthened by each other's action in the
course of centuries, now stood up against one another, and became
involved in a stormy contest, which discharged itself in bloody and
terrible outbursts, and at the same time was fraught with the decision
of questions most important for the European world.</p>

<p>The British islands, which in ancient times had been the extreme
border-land, or even beyond the extreme border-land of civilisation, had
now become one of its most important centres, and, owing to the union
just effected, had taken a grand position among the powers of the world.
But it is nevertheless clear at first sight that the constituent
elements of the population were far from being completely fused. In many
places in the two great islands the old Celtic stock still existed with
its original character unaltered. The Germanic race, which certainly had
an indubitable preponderance and was sovereign over the other, was split
into two different kingdoms, which, despite the union of the two crowns,
still remained distinct. The hostility of the two races was increased by
a difference of religion, which was closely connected with this
hostility though it was not merged in it. As a general rule the men of
Celtic extraction remained true to the Roman Catholic faith, while the
Germanic race was penetrated by Protestant convictions. Yet there were
Protestants among the former, and we know how numerous and how powerful
the Catholics were among the latter. Besides this, moreover, opposite
tendencies with regard to ecclesiastical forms struck root in the two
kingdoms. It was now the principal aim of the family by whose hereditary
claim the two kingdoms and the islands had been united, not only to
avert the strife of hostile elements, but also to reconcile them with
one another, and to unite them in a single commonwealth under its
authority, which all acknowledged and which it was desired to extend by
such an union. This was a scheme which opened a great prospect, but at
the same time involved no inconsiderable danger. Each of the two
kingdoms watched jealously over its separate independence. They would
not allow the dynasty to bring about a common government, which would
thus have set itself up above them, and would have established a new
kind of sovereignty over them. While the crown sought to enforce
prerogatives which were contested, it had to encounter in both kingdoms
the claims advanced by the holders of power in the nation, whom in turn
it endeavoured to repress. The quarrel was complicated by a conception
of the relations of the crown to foreign powers answering to its new
position, and running counter to the national view. At the same time
very perceptible analogies to this state of things were offered by the
religious wars, which began to convulse the continent more violently
than ever, and aroused corresponding feelings in the British isles. The
dynasty which tried to appease the prevailing opposition of principles
might find that, on the contrary, it rather fomented the strife, and was
itself drawn into it. This in fact took place. Springs of action of the
most opposite nature and antagonisms growing out of nationality,
religion, and politics, which could not be understood apart from one
another, co-operated in giving rise to events which do not form a single
continuous course of action, but rather present a varied and changing
result, due to elements which were grand and full of life, but still
waited for their final settlement. It is clear how much this depended on
the character and discernment of the king. </p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class='centersm'><a name="BV_I" id="BV_I"></a>
JAMES I AND HIS ADMINISTRATION OF DOMESTIC GOVERNMENT.</p>

<p>At one period of his youth James I had been accustomed to vary his
application to his lessons with bodily exercises. At that age he had
divided his days between learned studies and the chase of the smaller
game in Stirling Park, accompanied in both pursuits by friends and
comrades of the same age; and he retained during all his life the habits
he had then formed.<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a>
He spent only a couple of months in the year in
London, or at Greenwich: he preferred Theobald's, and still more distant
country seats like Royston and Newmarket, where he could give himself up
to hunting. Even before sunrise he was in motion, surrounded by a small
number of companions practised in the chase and selected for that
object, amongst whom he was himself one of the most skilful. He thought
that he might vie with Henry IV even in field sports; but he was not
hindered by his fondness for these amusements from continuing his
studies with unwearied application. He was impelled to these not,
strictly speaking, by thirst for general knowledge, although he was not
deficient in this, but principally by interest in the theological
controversies which engaged the attention of the world. He more than
once went through the voluminous works of Bellarmin; and, in order to
verify the citations, he had the old editions of the Fathers and of the
Decrees of the Councils sent him from Cambridge. In this task a learned
bishop stood at his side to assist him. He endeavoured with many a work
of his own to thrust himself forward in the conflict of opinions. He had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span>
the vanity of wishing to be regarded as the most learned man in the two
kingdoms, but he could only succeed in passing for a storehouse of all
sorts of knowledge; for a man who overestimates himself is commonly
punished by disregard even of his real merits. These may not meet with
recognition until later times. The writings of James I wore the pedantic
dress of the age; but in the midst of scholastic argumentation we yet
stumble upon apt thoughts and allusions. The images which he frequently
employs have not that delicacy of literary feeling which avoids what is
ungraceful, but they are original and sometimes striking in their
simplicity. Naturally thorough and acute, he labours not without success
to prove to his adversaries the untenableness of the grounds on which
they proceed, or the logical fallacy of their conclusions. Here and
there we catch the elevated tone of a consciousness that rests upon firm
conviction. Even in conversation he sought to turn away from particulars
as soon as they came under discussion, and to pass to general
considerations, a province in which he felt most at home. In his
incidental utterances which have been taken down, he displays sound
sense and knowledge of mankind. It is especially worth noticing how he
considers virtue and religion to be immediately connected with
knowledge&mdash;the confusions in the world appear to him for the most part
to arise from mediocrity of
knowledge<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a>&mdash;and
how highly moreover he
estimates a sense for truth. He finds the most material difference
between virtue and vice in the greater inward truthfulness of the
former. King James delivers many other well-weighed principles of calm
wisdom: it is only extraordinary how little his own practice
corresponded with them.<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a>
When in one of his earlier writings we mark
the seriousness with which he speaks of the duty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span>
incumbent on a king of
testing men of talent, of measuring their capacity, and of appointing
his servants not according to inclination but according to merit, we
should expect to find him in this respect a careful and conscientious
ruler. Instead of this we find that he always has favourites, whose
merits no one can discover; to whom he stands in the extraordinarily
compound relation of father, teacher, and friend, and to whom he allows
a share in the power which he possesses. He could never free himself
from a ruinous prodigality towards those about him, in spite of
resolutions of amendment. How soon were the costly objects flung away
which Elizabeth had collected and left behind at her
death!<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a>
How many possessions or sources of revenue accruing to the crown did he
allow to pass into private hands! Any regulation of his household
expenditure was as little to be expected from him in England as in
Scotland. Like the princes of the thirteenth century he considered that
the royal power assigned him privileges and advantages in which he had a
full right to allow his favourites and servants to share. Not seldom the
most scandalous abuses were connected with these: for instance, when the
court was to be provided with the common necessaries of life during its
journeys, it was required that they should be delivered to it at low
prices: the servants exacted more supplies than were wanted, and then
sold the surplus for their own profit. In grotesque contrast with the
disgraceful cupidity of his attendants is the exaggerated conception
which James had formed for himself of the ideal importance of the royal
authority, which at that time some persons attempted with metaphysical
acuteness to lay down almost in the same terms as the attributes of the
Deity. He had similar notions about his dignity and the unconditional
obligation of his subjects. Even in his Parliamentary speeches he did
not refrain from expressing them. He made no secret of them in his life
in the country, where he met with unbounded veneration from every one.
It was remarked as a point of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span>
contrast between him and Elizabeth, that
while she had always spoken of the love of her subjects, James on the
contrary was always talking of the obedience which they owed him on the
ground of divine and human right. And people recognised many other
points of contrast between them besides
this.<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a>
When the Queen had formed a resolution, she had never shrunk from the trouble of directing
her attention to its execution even in the minutest details. King James
did not possess this ardour; for he could not descend from the world of
studies and general views in which he lived, to take a searching
interest in the business of the government or of justice. He had indeed
been known to say that it was annoying to him to hear the arguments on
both sides quietly discussed in a question of right submitted to him;
for that in that case he was unable to come to any conclusion. The Queen
loved gallant men and characters distinguished for boldness: the King
was without any sense of military merit, and felt uncomfortable in the
presence of men of enterprising spirit. He thought that he could only
trust those whom he had chained to himself by favours, presents, and
benefits. The Queen served as a pattern of everything which was proper
and becoming. James, who restricted himself to the intercourse of a few
intimate friends, formed attachments which he thought were to serve as
the rule of life. He himself was slovenly; in England, as formerly in
Scotland, he neglected his appearance, and indulged in eccentricities
which appeared repulsive to others, and were taken amiss from him. Even
at that time there was a common feeling in England in favour of what is
becoming in good society; and although the feeling was for a long time
less deeply engraved on men's minds, and less sensitive to every outrage
than it became at a later period, men did not pardon the King for coming
into collision with it.</p>

<p>Hence this sovereign appeared in complete contradiction with himself.
Careless, petty, and at the same time most unusually proud; a lover of
pomp and ceremony, yet fond of solitude and retirement; fiery and at the
same time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span>
lax; a man of genius and yet pedantic; eager to acquire and
reckless in giving away; confidential and imperious; even in little
matters of daily life not master of himself, he often did what he would
afterwards rather have left undone. With all his knowledge and
acuteness, the high flight of his thoughts was often allied to a moral
weakness which among all circles did serious injury to that reverence
which had hitherto been reserved for those who held the highest
authority, and which was partly bestowed even on him. It could not seem
likely that such a man should be able to exercise great influence on the
fortunes of Britain.</p>

<p>He did however exercise such an influence. He gave the tone to the
policy of the Stuart dynasty, and introduced the complication in which
the destiny of his descendants was involved.</p>

<p>In the first years of his reign in England, so long as Robert Cecil was
alive, King James exercised no deep influence. The Privy Council
possessed to the full the authority which belonged to it by old custom.
James used simply to confirm the resolutions which were adopted in the
bosom of the Council under the influence of the Treasurer: he appears in
the reports of ambassadors as a phantom-king, and the minister as the
real ruler of the country.<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a>
After the death of Cecil all this was
changed. The King knew the party-divisions which prevailed in the
Council: he let its members have their own way, and even connived at the
relations they formed with foreign powers for their own interest; but he
knew how to hold the balance between them, and in the midst of their
divisions to carry out his own views. In those country seats, where no
one seemed to take thought for anything except the pleasures of the
chase and learned pursuits, the business of the state also was carried
on in course of time with ever-increasing ardour.<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a>
The secretaries about the King were incessantly busy, while the secretaries' chambers
in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span>
London were idle. Great affairs were generally transacted between
the King and the favourite in the ascendant at the time, in conferences
to which only a few others were admitted, and sometimes not even these.
The King himself decided; and the resolutions which were taken were
communicated to the Privy Council, which gradually became accustomed to
do nothing more than invest them with the customary forms. If it be
asked what the object of the King's efforts was, the answer must be that
it was to set the exercise of the supreme power free from the
controlling influence of the men of high rank to whom the King had
deferred on his first accession. This was generally the aim of the great
rulers of that century. This had been the principal end of the policy of
Philip II of Spain during his long political life: however the Kings and
Queens of France may have differed on other points, they were all, both
Henry III and Henry IV, Mary de' Medici while she was regent, and Lewis
XIII so soon as he succeeded to the exercise of power, at one in this
endeavour. James, who was a new sovereign in one of his kingdoms, and
almost always absent from the other, had more difficulties in his way
than other monarchs. Wherever it was possible he proceeded with energy
and rigour. People were astonished when they reckoned up the number of
considerable men who served him in high offices, and were then deprived
of them. He laboured incessantly to make way for the impartial exercise
of justice in the King's name throughout Scotland, in spite of the
privileges of the great Scottish nobles as its administrators. In his
ecclesiastical arrangements in that country, he was fond of insisting on
his personal wishes: in cases of emergency indeed he made known that all
the treasures of India were not of so much value in his eyes as the
observance of his ordinances; and he threatened the opponents of the
royal will with the King's anger, to which he then gave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span>
unbridled indulgence.<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a>
As he looked upon the Church of England as the best
bulwark against the influence of the Jesuits which he feared on the one
side, and that of the Puritans which he hated on the other, it was
naturally his foremost endeavour to fortify his power, and to unite the
two kingdoms with one another by the promotion and spread of the forms
of that Church. The essential motive of his system of colonisation in
Ireland was the wish to establish the Church, by the aid of which he
designed to subjugate or to suppress hostile elements. In England he
imparted to it a character still more clerical and removed from
Presbyterianism than that which had previously distinguished it: he
wished it to be as much withdrawn as possible from the action of civil
legislation. But in proportion as he supported himself on the Church he
fell out with the Parliament, in which aristocratic tendencies and
sympathies with popular rights and with Puritanism were blended with a
feeling of independence that was hateful to him. He once said that five
hundred kings were assembled there, and he thought that he was
fulfilling a duty in resisting them. The most momentous questions
affecting constitutional rights in regard to the freedom of elections,
freedom of speech, the limits of legislative power, and above all the
right of granting taxes, were brought forward under King James. And on
every other side he saw himself involved in a struggle with hostile
privileges and proud independent powers, from whose ascendancy both in
Church and State he was careful to keep himself free, while at the same
time he did not proceed to extremities or come to an absolute rupture.
He was naturally disposed, and was moreover led by circumstances, to
make it a leading rule of conduct, to adhere immovably to principles
which he had once espoused, and never to lose sight of them; but, having
done this, to appear vacillating and irresolute in matters of detail.
His position abroad involved the same apparent contradiction. Placed in
the midst of great rival powers, and never completely certain of the
obedience of his subjects, he sought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span>
to ensure the future for himself
by crafty and hesitating conduct. All the world complained that they
could not depend on him; each party thought that he was blinded by the
other. Those however who knew him more intimately assure us that we must
not suppose that he did not apprehend the snares which were laid for
him; that if only he were willing to use his eyes, he was as
clear-sighted as Argus; that there was no prince in the world who had
more insight into affairs or more cleverness in transacting them. They
say that if he appeared to lack decision, this arose from his fine
perception of the difficulties arising from the nature of things and
their necessary consequences; that he was just as slow and circumspect
in the execution as he was lively and expeditious in the discussion of
measures; that he knew how to moderate his choleric temperament by an
intentional reserve,<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a>
and that even his absence from the capital and
his residence in the country were made to second this systematic
hesitation; that, if a disputed point awaited decision, instead of
attending a meeting with the Privy Councillors who were with him, he
would take advantage of a fine day to fly his falcons, for he thought
that something might happen in the meanwhile, or some news be brought
in, and that the delay of an hour had often ere now been found
profitable.</p>

<p>It was then through no mere weakness on King James's part that he
conceded power to a favourite. In a letter to Robert Carr he describes
what he thought he had found in him, viz. a man who did not allow
himself to be diverted a hair's-breadth from his
service,<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a>
who never betrayed a secret, and who had nothing before his eyes but the advantage
and good name of his sovereign. The greater share that he secured for
such a man in the management of affairs the greater the power which he
believed that he himself exercised in them. The
<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1613.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span>
favourite who depended
entirely on the will of the king and knew his secrets, he supposed would
be both feared and powerful as a first minister, and would pave the way
by his influence upon the state for the carrying out of the views of the
sovereign. He thought that he could combine the government of the state
and the advance of monarchical ideas, with the comfort of a domestic
friendship with an inferior.</p>

<p>James himself brought about the alliance, which we noticed, between
Robert Carr, whom he raised to the earldom of Somerset, and the house of
Howard. By the union of the hereditary importance of an old family that
had almost always held the highest and most influential offices, with
the favour of the King which carried with it the fullest authority, a
power was in fact consolidated which for a while governed England. Henry
Howard, Earl of Northampton, the Lord Treasurer Thomas Howard, Earl of
Suffolk, and Robert Carr were considered the triumvirs of
England.<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a>
In the midst of this combination appears Lady Frances Howard, the
daughter of the Earl of Suffolk, whose divorce from Essex and marriage
with Somerset had sealed the political alliance between the two
families. She was young and beautiful, with an expression of modesty and
gentleness, but at the same time stately and brilliant, a fit creature
to move in a society that revelled in the enjoyment of life, in the
culture of the century, and in the possession of high rank. But what an
abyss of dark impulses and unbridled passion sometimes lies hid under
such a shining exterior! The Lady Frances had once sought to draw Prince
Henry into her net. Many said that she had employed magic for this
purpose; indeed they assumed that the early death of the Prince had been
brought on partly by this
means.<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a>
Her marriage with the king's
favourite was, if this be true, only a secondary satisfaction of her
ambition, but yet a satisfaction which she could not forego. Somerset
had an intimate friend, whose advice and services at a former period
<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1615.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span>
had been very useful to him, but who opposed this marriage and fell out
with him on account of it&mdash;his name was
Overbury.<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a>
Lady Frances swore to effect his death. We are revolted at the licence which personal
hate enjoyed of misusing the power of the state, when we read that
Overbury was first brought to the Tower, and then had creatures who
could be relied on set about him there, with whose help the victim was
removed out of the way by means of poison. Lady Frances was not the only
female poisoner among the higher classes of society. This mode of
assassination had spread in England as it had done in Italy and at times
in France. In these transactions the most abandoned profligacy allied
itself with the brilliancy and the advantages of a high position, but
they foreboded a speedy ruin. The authority of Somerset awakened
discontent and secret counterplots. He was naturally turbulent,
obstinate, and insolent, and had the presumption to behave in his usual
manner even to the King whom he set right with an air of intellectual
superiority which revived in the King's breast bitter recollection of
the years of his childhood. James put up with this conduct for a while;
he then, against the will of the favourite, set his hand to raise to a
level with him another young man, for whom he entertained a personal
liking: at last the misunderstanding came to an open rupture. And at the
same time an accident brought to light the circumstances of Overbury's
death.<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a>
All Somerset's old enemies raised their heads again, and
proceedings were instituted against him and his wife which terminated in
their condemnation.<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a>
The King pardoned them, to the extent of
allowing them to lead a life secluded from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</a></span>
the world; they resided afterwards in the same house, but, as far as is known, in complete
separation without even seeing one another.</p>

<p>Shortly before this event Henry Howard had died. Thomas Howard, whose
wife was accused of exercising a pernicious and corrupt influence upon
affairs, lost his office of High Treasurer. The place of Carr was
occupied by the young man above referred to, whom Carr's adversaries had
combined to push forward, George Villiers, a native of Leicestershire,
where his family had lived upon their own ancestral property from the
time of the Conquest. After the early death of his father, his mother, a
Beaumont by birth, a lady still young and full of ambition and knowledge
of the world, had educated him not only in the training of English
schools but in French ways and manners, and had then brought him to
court. He differed from Carr in being naturally good-tempered, and of a
courteous obliging disposition, which won the heart of every
one.<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a>
Although no one doubted that he would be spoilt by a higher position,
yet people thought that he could never become malicious like Somerset.
Lord Pembroke and Archbishop Abbot both gave him a helping hand in his
rise: the latter moved the Queen also, although she was not without
scruples, to aid in it. Villiers was a man after the King's own heart,
well-formed, capable of intellectual cultivation, devoted: in
consequence of the favour and confidence of the King the youth, who
after a time was created Duke of Buckingham, acquired a ruling position
in the English state. The old Admiral Effingham, Earl of Nottingham,
resigned his office in order to make room for him: some other high
officials were appointed under his influence and according to his views;
in a short time the white wands of the royal household and the
<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1617.</span>
under-secretaryships
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span>
and subordinate offices had been transferred to
the hands of his adherents and friends.</p>

<p>But foreign as well as domestic relations were affected by this change.
Somerset had stood in the most confidential relations with the Spanish
ambassador: he was accused of having betrayed to him the secrets of the
state from his office.<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a>
His wife, if not himself, was thought to
have drawn money from Spain. Probably the intelligence of this
behaviour, which came to the King's ears, contributed most to the
downfall of Somerset. This event did not in itself involve a change of
policy. In the advice which was given to the young favourite from a
well-informed source, it is presupposed that the good understanding with
Spain would continue: but it was now possible for the adversaries of
this power to bestir themselves again. Some of the most conspicuous men
of the other party, such as Winwood, the Secretary of State, would even
have been glad if open war with Spain had immediately broken out.</p>

<p>The mutual opposition between these powerful tendencies, and the men who
made them their own, brought the career of Walter Ralegh to a close.</p>

<p>Somerset was Ralegh's personal enemy, and had gained possession of his
best estate. After his fall Ralegh was liberated from the Tower. He
still lay under the weight of a sentence which had been pronounced
against him on the occasion of the plot which bears his name. He might
have purchased its removal; but he was assured by the most influential
voices that he had nothing more to fear from it; and he thought that he
could apply the money more profitably to the execution of the great
design which he had long ago formed, and which he had never for an
instant lost sight of during his captivity. A story was then afloat that
after the destruction of the kingdom of Peru the descendants of the
Incas had founded another kingdom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span>
between the Amazon and the Orinoco,
the Dorado of the Spaniards. It was Ralegh's ambition to open to his
countrymen this region which would be easily accessible from the coasts,
of which he had formerly taken possession in the name of England. The
old reputation of Ralegh's name procured him sufficient support for his
expedition, not only from the merchants, but also from wealthy private
individuals; and the King gave him a patent which empowered him to sail
to the ports of America still in possession of the heathen, in order to
open commercial intercourse with them, and to spread the Christian,
especially the Reformed, faith among
them.<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a>
In July 1617 Ralegh set sail from Plymouth harbour for this object, with seven ships of war and
a number of small transports carrying about 700 men.</p>

<p>It was presupposed that in such an enterprise all hostilities against
the Spaniards would be avoided. When the Spanish ambassador complained
of this expedition undertaken by a man who had already on one occasion
been very troublesome to the Spanish colonies, the Privy Council
answered that Ralegh was pledged by his instructions to do no damage to
the Spaniards; and that 'if he violated them his head was there to pay
for it.'<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a>
The King himself repeated this answer to him.</p>

<p>Ralegh in fact guarded against any collision with the Spaniards on his
voyage. He was said not to have taken a single Spanish vessel, and he
directed his course without stopping to Guiana, the goal which he had
set before himself. But the Spaniards had become powerful there,
although not until after his former visit. From Caraccas they had
conquered the natives, who were engaged in internal wars, and had firmly
established themselves at a short distance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span>
from the coast. What was
likely to happen if they opposed the forces which Ralegh landed to
search for the gold mines which he had formerly seen there? Ralegh
remembered full well what a danger he ran if he engaged in a struggle
and fought with them: he knew that he was thereby forfeiting his life.
But on the other side, was he to return without fulfilling his purpose,
and to burden himself with the reproach of not having told the truth?
Worst of all, was he to fail in effecting the object which he had
entertained all his life long, and not to achieve the discovery on which
he staked the future glory of his name? It was perhaps the greatest
moment in a life that almost always lifts itself above the ordinary
level, when the thirst for discovery gained the victory over
considerations of legality and the danger involved in discarding them.
And well might he have hoped that not only pardon but praise would have
been accorded him, if he had actually obtained possession of the gold
mines, by whatever means. He commanded his men when they advanced inland
to behave to the Spaniards as the Spaniards behaved to them. A collision
was thus unavoidable. It took place at S. Thomas, which was destroyed,
but the Spaniards nevertheless had completely the superiority: Ralegh's
only son was killed; and the captain who had the charge of the
expedition was so disheartened that he committed suicide. These
disasters involved the utter failure of the expedition. His crews, who
were naturally insubordinate, quarrelled among themselves, and on the
voyage home the fleet dispersed. Ralegh came back to England without an
ounce of gold, and without having effected any result whatever: he
appeared in the light of an adventurer who had wantonly desired to break
the peace with Spain. And when the ambassador of this power asked for
full and signal satisfaction, in order to restore the good understanding
which Ralegh's enterprise had at once interrupted, was it to be expected
that the King should take under his protection the man who had not
complied with the conditions prescribed to him, and whom for other
reasons he did not love? And moreover the pulse of free generosity which
befits a sovereign did not beat in the breast of King James. He
<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1618.</span>
consented that the old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span>
sentence of condemnation, for fifteen years
suspended over Ralegh's head, should now be enforced against him. It had
been pronounced against him for entering into a secret alliance with
Spain; an attack on Spain led to its execution. Ralegh and the King
exhibit a contrast between ambition that scorns danger on the one side,
and caution that supports itself by the forms of law on the other, such
as even in England has hardly ever been so sharply drawn. The King could
not possibly get any good by his conduct. The position of England in the
world depended upon the resistance that she offered to the preponderance
of Spain in both the Indies and in Europe. The King detached himself
from one of the chief interests of the nation when he allowed a felon's
death to be inflicted on the man of lofty genius, who had undertaken, by
an ill-advised attempt it is true, to give effect in America to this
feeling of world-wide opposition. James thought that his welfare lay in
maintaining the peace with Spain. But we know that at an earlier date he
had entered on a course adverse to Spain, and that even now he had not
entirely renounced it. What confusion must eventually follow from this
divided policy! </p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class='centersm'><a name="BV_II" id="BV_II"></a>
COMPLICATIONS ARISING OUT OF THE AFFAIRS OF THE PALATINATE.</p>

<p>During these years there had been persons at the helm of state in most
countries, who either from natural disposition or from a calculation of
present circumstances had cherished peaceful views. In spite of all the
activity of Spanish policy, Philip III and his minister Lerma clung to
the principle that the rest needed to restore the strength of the
exhausted monarchy must be granted to it. The Emperor Matthias owed the
crown he wore to his alliance with the Protestants: his first minister
Klesel, although a cardinal, was a lukewarm Catholic, and a man of
conciliatory views in general. The Regent of France, Mary de' Medici,
had surrendered the warlike designs of her husband when she entered on
the exercise of sovereign power. Christian IV of Denmark held similar
views. He declined the proposals of the Poles, which were aimed at a
renewal of the war against Sweden: he preferred, with the approval of
his council of state, to proceed with the building of towns and harbours
in which he was engaged.</p>

<p>Hence it was possible on the whole to carry out a policy such as that
maintained by James I. It corresponded to the tone prevalent among the
other powers.</p>

<p>From time to time it seemed probable that the opposing forces which were
contending with one another in the depths of European life, would burst
forth and shatter the peaceful state of affairs. For the advancing
revival of Catholicism roused the hostile feelings of Protestants, while
the union of the German and the independent feeling of the Italian
princes resisted the extension of the alliances of Spain. In the
<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1617.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</a></span>
year 1615, on the Netherland frontier, and in the year 1616 on the boundaries
between Austria and Venice, warlike movements began which threatened to
prove the commencement of a general struggle: but these were disputes of
an essentially local nature, and peaceful dispositions still maintained
the upper hand.</p>

<p>But in the year 1617 and 1618 a question arose which no longer allowed
this state of things to continue. It concerned the imperial dignity of
Germany, but it exercised so powerful a secondary influence upon affairs
most thoroughly English that even in a history of England a short
discussion must be devoted to it.</p>

<p>The increasing weakness of the Emperor Matthias rendered his speedy end
probable; and all preparations were already being made in the house of
Austria to secure the succession of the Archduke Ferdinand of Styria to
the imperial throne, as well as to his own hereditary kingdoms and
provinces. No arrangement could in itself have been more suitable in the
nature of things. Ferdinand was the most vigorous scion of his house;
and both the German Archdukes laid their own well-founded claims at his
feet. A resignation on the part of Philip III of the claims which he
inherited from his mother was thought indispensable: but even this
created no difficulty. It was merely stipulated that Ferdinand should
indemnify him for resigning them; and this he was willing to do. It only
remained that the crown of the German Empire should also be assured to
him. The Archdukes were eager for an immediate negotiation on the
subject, and were already certain of the support of the spiritual
electors.</p>

<p>It is clear however that the succession was not merely a change of
persons. The place of the peaceable and moderate Matthias would be
filled by one of the most devoted pupils of the Jesuits in the person of
Ferdinand, who had made himself terrible to the Protestants by an
unsparing restoration of Catholicism in his own country. Moreover the
alliance between the German and Spanish line, which had been loosened in
the last few years, was to be consolidated into a union resting on
common interests: so that it seemed likely that Austria would enjoy a
supremacy like that which had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span>
established in the time of Charles
V. The letters which passed between the members of that house, and which
had accidentally been divulged, excited surprise by the note of general
hostility which they struck, while the share of the Palatinate and of
Brandenburg in the election was treated in them as a formality which
could be dispensed with in case of
necessity.<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a></p>

<p>It is quite intelligible that the Protestants should be agitated by this
discovery, and should entertain the idea of opposing the election of
Ferdinand. Not that one of them thought of acquiring the throne for
himself; they did not resist the election of a Catholic emperor as such,
but they wished to guard against the resumption of the combination
between the Austro-Spanish power and the prerogatives of the imperial
crown. At first their eyes fell upon Duke Maximilian of Bavaria, whom
they would by this means have for ever detached from that power. The
Elector Frederick controlled the jealousy which, as Elector Palatine, he
felt for a branch of the same house, and went to Munich in order to
prevail on his cousin to consent to this arrangement; for, according to
the plea advanced on grounds of imperial right, the imperial crown could
not be allowed to become hereditary in the house of Austria. He hoped
that the Archbishop Ferdinand of Cologne, the brother of the Duke of
Bavaria, would support him, and that his influence would win over the
other spiritual electors also. The Union and the League would then have
combined to oppose the house of Austria.</p>

<p>But meanwhile open resistance to the claims of this family had already
broken out in its own provinces. While the Emperor Matthias was still
alive, the Archduke Ferdinand, through the combination, as prescribed by
Bohemian usage, of an election with the recognition of his hereditary
claims,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span>
had been acknowledged future King of Bohemia, and had been
already crowned, on condition that he would not mix in public affairs
before the death of his predecessor. But immediately after the
coronation people thought that they could discover his hand in every act
of the government. Cardinal Klesel, the man in whom the greatest
confidence was reposed, especially by the Protestant portion of the
Estates, had been overthrown owing to the influence of the Spanish
ambassador. In opposition to the influence thus exercised, 'against the
practices and snares of the Jesuits,' as the phrase ran, the zealous
Protestants who, when Ferdinand was accepted as King, had been thrust
into the background or had retired, now obtained the upper hand in the
country, and proceeded to open insurrection while the Emperor Matthias
was still alive. This Prince was the first who was overturned by the
collision of the two parties, whose enmity was again reviving, and
between whom he had thought of mediating. He was bitterly disappointed
by his failure. After his death the Bohemians thought themselves
justified in refusing any longer to acknowledge Ferdinand as their King,
and in seeking on the contrary for a worthier successor to the throne,
on the ground that in Ferdinand's election the traditional forms had not
been accurately observed, and that he was undermining all religious and
political freedom. Their eyes had even fallen on Catholic princes; but
as the motive which prompted their resistance was certainly the
religious one, their attention was still more drawn to the most eminent
Protestant prince in their vicinity, Frederick Elector Palatine, who as
head of the Union was himself the principal opponent of the election of
Ferdinand as Emperor.</p>

<p>On the very first steps taken in this matter, the King of England was
affected by these movements. We learn that, on the occasion of the
overtures made by Frederick, Maximilian of Bavaria had been moved to
write to James I, and to express to him his satisfaction at the family
connexion which had sprung up between them. The interest of the
Palatinate and of England seemed one and the same, especially as the
King was still considered a member and protector
<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1618.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</a></span>
of the Union. The presumption that the son-in-law of the King of England would find
support from his power, contributed greatly to the importance which the
Elector at this moment enjoyed.</p>

<p>But at the same time it was evident in what an embarrassing position
James I was now placed, and that not only on account of the danger
threatening the continuance of peace, which he thought no price too high
to secure: his hands were tied not merely by this general consideration,
but by another special reason as well. He was at that moment seriously
engaged in a treaty for the marriage of his son with a Spanish infanta,
which was to carry out the long-talked-of alliance between his family
and the Austro-Spanish line.</p>

<p>The first overtures in regard to the present Prince of Wales had been
made by the Duke of Lerma to the English envoy, Digby, to whom he opened
a proposal for the marriage of Prince Charles with Mary, daughter of
Philip III. The Spanish ambassador, Gondomar, had then taken the
management of the affair in hand. We should do him wrong by supposing
that he wished to deceive the King. Gondomar rather belonged to the
party who looked for the welfare of the Spanish monarchy in the
maintenance of peace, especially with England. The scheme of the
marriage was part of the system of powerful alliances by which it was
sought to prop the greatness of Spain. Even the uncertain rumour of this
scheme, which was instantly propagated, sufficed to agitate the
Protestant party in Europe and in England itself. The King declared that
he moved only with leaden foot towards the proposal which had been made
to him; and that, if it were seen that the alliance was dangerous to
religion or to existing agreements, it should never take effect. But
even the Secretary of State, Ralph Winwood, who repeated this
declaration, disapproved of the scheme, as did also the whole school of
Robert Cecil. They had wished to marry the Prince to the daughter of a
German line, perhaps to a Brandenburg princess; and the States General
offered their money and their services in order to win the consent of
any such princess, and to convey her to England. Many would have
preferred even a domestic
<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1619.</span>
alliance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</a></span>
after the old fashion. Opposition
was also offered on the part of the Church of England. Archbishop Abbot
only delayed to urge it until the conditions of the marriage should come
under discussion. But the King likewise had the approval of influential
voices on his side. It was considered possible to conclude the marriage,
and yet to preserve the other alliances of the country. People thought
that England would in that case be only the more courted by both
parties, and that the peace of the world would rest on the shoulders of
the King.</p>

<p>But what a contradiction was involved in the ascendancy which these
ideas obtained? The hereditary right to the crown of Bohemia, which the
estates of that country would no longer acknowledge, belonged to the
house of Spain. It was intended that the Elector Palatine should step
into its place by election; and this prince was son-in-law to the King.
After James had married his daughter to the head of the Protestants in
Germany, he conceived the thought of marrying his son to the member of a
family which had made the patronage and protection of Catholicism its
special calling. It seemed as if he was purposely introducing into his
own family the disunion which rent Europe in twain.</p>

<p>The negotiations in Germany after a time resulted in the victory of the
house of Austria, which in spite of all opposition carried the day in
the election of the Emperor. The Elector Palatine acknowledged Ferdinand
II without hesitation. But almost at the same moment he received the
news that he had himself been elected king by the Estates of Bohemia. It
cannot be proved that he was privy to this beforehand: even the rumour
that his wife urged him to accept the crown because she was a king's
daughter meets with no confirmation. They were not so blind as not to
perceive the enormous danger in which the acceptance of this offer would
involve them. In reply to a question of the Elector, his wife answered
that she regarded the election as a divine dispensation, that if he
determined to accept it, which she left entirely to his consideration,
she for her part was resolved to undergo everything that might follow
from it. We must not regard as hypocrisy the prominence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span>
which the prince and the princess alike gave to religious considerations. Such was
the fashion of the times generally, and especially of the party to which
they belonged.</p>

<p>The Elector Frederick however did not yet declare his decision. The
question of the acceptance of the crown of Bohemia was debated from
every point of view by the very councillors who had just been present at
the election of the Emperor. Their decision was in favour of the prince
inviting first of all the advice of his friends in the empire, of the
States-General, but especially of the King of England, and making sure
of their support.<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a>
The Bohemian envoys, who most urgently requested
an immediate answer, were put off with the reply that the Elector must
first of all be certain of the consent of the father of his consort.
Count Christopher Dohna was sent to England to persuade King James to
give it. He was commissioned to deliver to him a letter from the
Princess-Electress in which she most urgently entreated her father to
support her husband and to prove his paternal love to them both.</p>

<p>King James came now face to face with the greatest question of his life,
which summed up and brought to light, so to speak, all the cross
purposes and conflicting political aims among which he had long moved. A
word from him was now of the greater consequence, as the States-General
declared that they would act as he did. But what was his decision to be?
He was not unmoved by the thought that the prospect of possessing a
crown was opened to his son-in-law and grandchildren. On the other hand
he was greatly impressed by a representation which the King of Spain
forwarded to him, that his right to the crown of Bohemia was
indisputable&mdash;as in fact the Spanish line had a contingent claim to the
succession&mdash;and that he would contend for it with all his strength: on
which King James said that he also as a great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span>
sovereign had an interest
in seeing that no one was deprived of his own. The theories of James I
about the hereditary rights of princes, the electoral rights of the
Estates, and the influence of religious profession in these matters,
presented themselves to his mind together with his wishes on the
question of the aggrandisement of his dynasty. He remarked that it could
not be allowed that subjects should presume to fall away from their
sovereign on a question of religion; he even feared that this doctrine
might react to his own prejudice on England. In these considerations the
balance evidently was in favour of a refusal. James would have deserved
well of the world if he had given utterance to that refusal, and had
decisively dissuaded his son-in-law from accepting the crown. And from
his oft-repeated assertions at a later period, to the effect that the
Elector had proceeded on his own responsibility, we might think that he
had expressed himself in definite terms in favour of a different course.</p>

<p>In reality however this is not the case. He condemned the revolt of the
Bohemians against Matthias: in regard to Ferdinand it was his opinion
that they should prove from the old capitulations their right to declare
his election and coronation invalid, and to proceed to a new election,
in which case he would himself support
them.<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a>
He expressed himself
in such a manner, that even members of the Privy Council received the
impression that he would approve of and even support the acceptance of
the crown when once it had taken place. Christopher Dohna relates that
in the negotiations at that time he one day declared that his master,
the Elector, was ready to refuse the crown if the King required him to
do so; and that James replied, 'I do not say
that.'<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</a></span>
Monarchs are set in authority in order that they may pronounce
definitive decisions according to the best of their own judgment. It is
sometimes their duty to take a decided line. James, who hitherto had
always stood between different parties, could not nerve himself at this
eventful moment for a firm and straightforward resolve. In the monstrous
dilemma in which the various questions at issue were becoming involved
he could not come to any decision. The kindest thing that can be said of
him is that at this moment his nature was not equal to the requirements
of the situation.</p>

<p>Count Dohna, following the example of James's councillors, concluded
from his expressions that he was not only not opposed to the acceptance
of the crown, but that he would allow himself to be enlisted in its
favour, and would support it. And there is no doubt that this view
exercised a decisive influence upon the final resolution of the Elector
Frederick. He certainly was already strongly inclined to accept the
crown in opposition to his more clear-sighted and sagacious mother, but
in agreement with his ardent wife: but he had not yet uttered the final
words when Dohna's report came
in.<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a>
When he learned from this that
the King was not decidedly unfavourable, the Elector thought that he
recognised a dispensation of God which he would not decline to carry
out. In the presence of his councillors at the castle of Heidelberg he
declared to the Bohemian ambassadors that he accepted the crown; and
soon afterwards he set out for Bohemia. In October 1619 (Oct. 25/Nov. 4)
he was crowned at Prague.</p>

<p>What unforeseen consequences however for himself and his friends, for
Germany and for England, were destined to spring out of this
undertaking!</p>

<p>In London, where the popular party had already from the first fixed
their eyes on the Princess, this step was welcomed with the most joyous
approval. It was represented to the King that the most brilliant
prospect was
<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1620.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</a></span>
thus opened to his family; that on the next vacancy his
son-in-law, who already himself held two votes in the electoral body,
could not fail to be chosen Emperor; and that England would by this
means acquire the greatest influence on the continent. It was expected
that these feelings for his family, and the successful issue of events,
would work together to detach him again from Spain.</p>

<p>James on one occasion, on receiving the news of the confinement of his
daughter, drank a bowl of wine 'to the health of the King and Queen of
Bohemia.' He went so far as this, and people thought it worth while to
record the event; but he could not be brought to acknowledge Frederick
openly. He was not satisfied with the proof of their right advanced by
the Bohemians: in conversation he advocated the right of Austria.</p>

<p>Spain and the League, as was inevitable, joined forces with Austria. In
the first instance the Palatinate itself was the object of their joint
attack. How could men have helped thinking that King James would
resolutely take the inheritance of his grandsons under his protection?
The Union invited him to do so, reminding him of the obligation imposed
on him by his connexion with them mentioned above: they said it was no
favour, but justice which they demanded of him. But James replied that
he had pledged himself only to repel open and unjustifiable attacks, but
that in the present case the Palatinate was the attacking party, and
that Austria stood on the defensive. The Union presently saw itself
compelled to conclude a treaty with the League, which left that power
free to act against Bohemia. The Palatinate however was not secured
thereby against the
Spaniards.<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a>
To effect this, it would have been
deemed advisable to make an attack from Holland on the Spanish
Netherlands; for if a single fortified place had been occupied there,
the Palatinate would have had nothing more to fear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span>
from Spain. But to this measure also James refused his consent: he thought that this would
be equivalent to beginning war, which he did not wish.</p>

<p>The general sympathy of the nation was strong enough at last to cause a
large English regiment of 2500 men, under Horace Vere, to be sent on the
continent, in order that the Palatinate, on which the Spaniards now
advanced, might not become utterly a prey to them. The Earls of Essex
and Oxford, who had contributed most to raise the regiment, themselves
took part in the campaign. They were joined by many other young men of
leading families, who wished to learn the art of war. But they had
received from the King positive commands to commit no act of hostility.
The troops of the Union, who showed themselves quite ready to fight the
Spaniards, were withheld by the threat that in that case the King would
recall these troops instead of sending two more regiments to join them,
the hope of which he held out to them in the event of their obedience.
It was enough for the King that the English troops occupied the most
important places. Vere held Mannheim, Herbert Heidelberg, Burrows
Frankenthal; while the greater part of the country fell into the hands
of the Spaniards.</p>

<p>Europe had reason to be alarmed at the advantage which accrued to the
Spanish monarchy from this affair. The Tyrol and Alsace were already
promised them to form links between Lombardy and the Netherlands: the
possession of the Lower Palatinate completed their chain of
communication.</p>

<p>The action of Spain and England presented a marked contrast. Spain,
while it forsook Lerma's policy, held together all its friends&mdash;Germany,
Austria, the League, the Pope, the Archducal Netherlands&mdash;and combined
their forces for joint action on a large scale; while King James, in
clinging to the policy of peace, let his allies fall asunder and
crippled their activity.</p>

<p>But if James so acted in the case of the Palatinate which he wished to
save, what might be fully expected in the case of Bohemia, with regard
to which he openly declared, after some hesitation, that he could take
no further part in its affairs? The new King found no hearty obedience
among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</a></span>
the Bohemians, partly because they found themselves deceived in
their expectation of being assisted with troops by the Union, and with
money by England. But worse than all, the ill-disciplined soldiery being
without pay, broke out in mutiny: they were almost more ready to help
themselves to their arrears by an attack upon the capital than to defend
their sovereign or their country. On the other hand the soldiers of
Austria and of the League, well paid and well disciplined, were spurred
on by zealous priests. On their first attack they scattered the troops
of Frederick to the four winds (November 1620). It would not have been
impossible for Frederick to wage a defensive war in Bohemia; but regard
to the danger into which the Queen would have been thrown in consequence
prevented the attempt. That one day cost them both crown and country.</p>

<p>It is impossible to describe the impression which the news of this
defeat produced in London. The King was held blameable because not a
single soldier commissioned by him had been found beside his daughter to
draw the sword in her defence. This was attributed either to culpable
negligence of his own affairs, or to the influence of the Spanish
ambassador. Not Gondomar himself, who was too shrewd to act thus, but
certainly his friends and Catholics generally, let their joy at this
event be known. The citizens responded with manifestations that were
directed against the King himself. A placard was put up in which he was
told that he would be made to feel the anger of the people, if in this
affair he any longer followed a policy opposed to its views.</p>

<p>James I could no longer put off the question what steps he was to take.
The tidings reached him at Newmarket, where he was spending the cold and
gloomy days in hunting. He broke off this amusement and hastened to
Westminster, in order to attend council with his ministers.</p>

<p>Towards the end of December a meeting was held, in which the secretary
Naunton depicted the whole position of the foreign policy of England,
and drew from it the conclusion that the King must above all arm, as in
that case he could carry on war, or at least negotiate with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</a></span>
firmness and some prospect of success. King James himself brought the affair of
Bohemia under discussion. He complained, and seemed to feel it as an
injury to his paternal authority, that the Elector Frederick even now
continued to make the acknowledgment of his right to the crown of
Bohemia a condition of his accepting the mediation offered by the King.
Viscount Doncaster, who had just returned from a mission to Germany,
fell on his knees before him, in order to remark to him that Frederick
deserved no blame for clinging to a right which he supposed to be valid:
that his refusal was not addressed to James as a father, but as King of
England.<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a>
James I distinctly stated afresh that he could not and
would not espouse the cause of his son-in-law in Bohemia. But by this
time not only was Frederick's new crown as good as lost, but his whole
existence was endangered; the greater part of his hereditary territory
was in the enemy's hands. James declared with unusual decision that he
would not allow the Palatinate, which would one day descend to his
grandchildren, to be wrested from them; that he was resolved to send to
the Continent in the next year an army sufficient to reconquer it. It
might be asked if this measure also would not inevitably lead to a
breach with Spain. King James did not think so. He thought that he could
carry on a merely local quarrel, and yet at the same time avoid a war on
the part of the one power against the other. He did not intend to attack
the King of Spain's own dominion, so long as that sovereign did not
meddle with his.</p>

<p>But however that might be, whether he was to begin war, though only on a
limited scale, or whether he wished to prosecute negotiations with
success, in any case it was necessary for him to arm. But for this
purpose he required other means besides those of which he could dispose
at his own discretion. </p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class='centersm'><a name="BV_III" id="BV_III"></a>
PARLIAMENT OF THE YEAR 1621.</p>

<p>We already know the antipathy of James to the Parliament, which had
become a power to which, as soon as it was manifested in a newly
assembled House, the power of the King was obliged to bend. James had
already often felt the ascendancy of Parliament. The schemes of union
with Scotland, which filled his soul with ambition, had been shattered
by the resistance of that body. The exclusively Protestant disposition
which prevailed there had made it impossible for him to give a legal
sanction to the favour which he entertained for the Catholics, and which
his views of policy naturally disposed him to show. He had been obliged
to desist from the attempt to secure financial independence by
surrendering the feudal privileges of the crown. The Parliament raised
claims which the King regarded as attacks on the prerogative of the
crown: even his advances to it had been met by a stubborn resistance. In
the ordinary course of things he would never again have summoned
Parliament together.</p>

<p>This complication in foreign affairs then arose. All parties, including
even the King himself, were convinced that England must step forth armed
among the contending powers of the world: and that, not in the fashion
of the last expedition, so little in keeping with the situation, when
private support and tacit sympathy found the means, but on a large
scale, as the position of the kingdom among the great powers demanded.
But without Parliamentary grants this was impossible. The summoning of a
new Parliament was therefore an incontestable necessity.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">A.D. 1621.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</a></span>
But on the other hand there was not wanting reasons for hesitation, for
it could not be disguised that concessions would be inevitable. King
James saw that as plainly as any one, and declared himself beforehand
ready to make them. In contradiction to his former assertions he gave
out that he would this time allow grievances to be freely alleged, and
would give his best assistance in removing them. He said that he wished
to meet Parliament half way, and that it should find him an honourable
man. From the investigation of abuses the less was feared because the
late opposition was ascribed to a factious resistance to Somerset's
administration. But that favourite had since fallen: and of the leaders
of that opposition several had gone over to the government, and some had
died.<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a>
The declared purpose of arming for the reconquest of the
Palatinate was in accordance with the feelings of the nation and of the
Protestants: no doubt was felt that it would win universal sympathy.</p>

<p>This was in fact the case. The most favourable impression was produced
when the King in his speech from the throne (January 30, 1621), which
was principally taken up with this subject, declared his resolution to
defend the hereditary claim of his grandchildren to the territories of
the Palatine Electorate, and the free profession of Protestantism; to
compel peace if it were necessary sword in hand; for which objects he
claimed the assistance of the country. Parliament did not hesitate for
an instant to express its concurrence with him in these designs. Two
subsidies were granted on the spot, and the resolution was carried into
effect during the continuance of the debates, a step which was
altogether unprecedented. The King thanked the Parliament for this
extraordinary readiness, which would, he said, increase his importance
both at home and abroad.</p>

<p>But this did not prevent Parliament on the other hand from bringing
forward its claims with all possible energy. The power of granting money
was the sinew of all its powers. The necessity of asking assistance from
Parliament in urgent embarrassments, which the Tudors had avoided as far
as possible, now appeared as pressing as ever. Was it not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</a></span>
to be expected that demands should call forth counter-demands? And the
opposition in the previous Parliament rested on a far wider basis than
that of hostility to Somerset: at the present election also the
candidates of the government were rejected in most of the counties and
towns.<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a></p>

<p>The commission appointed for the investigation of abuses did not deal
only with those which were acknowledged to be such. The principal
question rather concerned the competence of the crown to confer such
privileges as those out of which the abuses originated. Under the lead
of Edward Coke, the great lawyer, Parliament adopted a principle which
secured for it a firm standing ground.</p>

<p>Coke, who moreover did not think it necessary to ask the King's consent
for liberty of speech, because this was, he thought, an independent
right of Parliament, vindicated the position that no royal proclamation
had validity if it contradicted an act of Parliament or an existing law.
He took his stand on the times of the later Plantagenet and of the
Lancastrian kings: and he considered that the form which the relation
between the government and Parliament then assumed was the only legal
form. But the government of James I had granted extraordinarily
obnoxious privileges&mdash;for instance, the right of setting up taverns with
a restriction on the entertainment of guests by private individuals, or
by the old inns; and again the right of arresting acknowledged vagrants.
But the most obnoxious grants were those of patents for the monopoly of
some trade, which were annoying to the whole mercantile class, and
brought profit only to a few favoured individuals. Coke argued that the
patents were either in themselves illegal, or injurious in their
enforcement, or both together. While he proved to Parliament its
forgotten or disregarded rights, Coke won the full confidence of both
Houses alike: the Upper and the Lower House made common cause. Thus the
system of government as it had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</a></span>
developed under the Tudors and
continued under the Stuarts was encountered face to face by another
system, which rested upon other precedents and principles.</p>

<p>And people were not content with merely declaring the patents invalid;
they called those to account who had got possession of them, and even
the high officials who had contributed to issue them. A general
commotion ensued: every day fresh information came in and fresh
complaints were drawn
up.<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a></p>

<p>The Lord Chancellor Bacon had been already brought into danger by this
affair. He had assisted in introducing monopolies of different
manufactures under the pretence that work would be found for the poor by
means of them. It was well known that in matters of this sort he had for
the most part followed the suggestions of the Prime Minister. While
Bacon was defending the ideal mission of the monarchy, he had the
weakness to identify himself too closely with the accidental form which
authority just at that particular moment took. In return he found on the
other hand that the attacks really aimed at the government recoiled in
the first instance upon him. In reality they were directed principally
against Buckingham. In order to save him from destruction, suggestions
had been made to the King that he might prefer to dissolve Parliament,
as it seemed plain that he had far more reason to expect harm from the
attacks than advantage from the grants made by that body. Buckingham
saved himself only by coming forward against the monopolies himself, in
accordance with the advice of his ecclesiastical confidant, Dean
Williams. Claims had been made against two of his brothers also on
account of the monopolies. Far from taking them under his protection, he
said on the contrary that his father had still a third son who was
determined to root out abuses; and that not until the present
proceedings had been taken had he recognised the advantages of
parliamentary government. Upon this, the leading men with whom Williams
had formed a connexion, desisted from attacking the First Minister.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</a></span>
It even came about that a person of high rank, accused at the bar of the
House of Lords, who had let fall an expression, comparing Buckingham to
old favourites of hateful memory, was obliged to retract it with
considerable ceremony. But a victim was required: one was found in the
Lord Chancellor Bacon.</p>

<p>Although condemned by law and morality, an evil practice still prevailed
of receiving presents of money in official transactions. The sums were
known and have been registered, by means of which Gondomar retained the
services of a number of statesmen in the interest of Spain. How many
similar abuses in the control of the Treasury had been brought to light
only a short time before! Even the great philosopher, who in his
writings is so zealous against bribes, contracted during his
administration the stain of receiving them. That he might stand on an
equality with the great lords, he incurred inordinate expenses, which
these bribes assisted him to meet. Edward Coke was wholly in the right
when he exclaimed that a corrupt judge was 'the grievance of
grievances.'<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a>
Two-and-twenty cases were proved in which the supreme
judge, the Lord Chancellor of England, had taken presents from the
parties concerned. Lord Bacon made no attempt to justify his conduct; he
only affirmed&mdash;and this appears in fact to have been the case&mdash;that in
his decisions he never was influenced by the presents that had been made
him. When he was called to account for them, he acquiesced himself in
the justice of the proceeding, for he allowed that a reform was
necessary, and only deemed himself unfortunate in being the person with
whom it began. The Lords pronounced sentence upon him that he should
never again fill an official position, nor be capable of sitting in
Parliament, and that he should be banished from the precincts of the
court.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</a></span>
Apart from its importance as affecting individuals, this event is very
important in the history of the constitution, which now returned to its
former paths. That the Lower House again as in old times was able to
procure the fall of one of the highest officials, is an evidence of its
growing power. That the First Minister and favourite allowed his
intimate friend to fall is a proof of the weakness of the highest
authority, which moreover ought itself to have attacked abuses of this
kind. Bacon justly remarked that reform would soon reach higher regions.</p>

<p>But while Parliament, which the government had no inclination to
withstand openly, thus obtained the ascendancy in domestic matters, it
was also already turning its eyes in the direction of foreign affairs.
These were times in which a warm religious sympathy was awakened by the
advance which the counter-reformation was making in the hereditary
dominions of Austria, as well as in France, and by the persecutions
which befell the Protestants in both countries. The Spaniards were again
engaging in war for the subjugation of the Netherlands. In Parliament,
on the other hand, it was thought necessary to combine with the
Republic, and to equip a fleet to assist the Huguenots, and even to
attack Spain, in order thus to make a diversion in favour of the
Palatinate. At the very time of the opening of Parliament the ban of the
empire was pronounced against Frederick Elector Palatine amid the sound
of trumpets and drums in the Palace at Vienna. This was regarded in the
whole Protestant world as an injustice, for it was thought that
Ferdinand II had been injured by Frederick only as King of Bohemia, and
not as Emperor: and on the same grounds the English Parliament was of
opinion that the execution of the ban ought to be hindered by force of
arms; and it showed itself dissatisfied that the King sought to meet the
evil only by demonstrations and embassies.</p>

<p>We can easily understand that the attitude of Parliament aroused the
anxiety of the King. He caused the debates on the war to be put a stop
to, remarking that they infringed his prerogative, for which great
affairs of this kind were exclusively reserved. And yet, so
extraordinary was the complication of affairs that the declarations made
in Parliament
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</a></span>
were not altogether displeasing to him. In June he
adjourned Parliament, without formally proroguing it. What was the
reason of this? Because Parliament had brought in a new bill containing
the severest enactments against Jesuits and Catholic recusants. The King
refused to accept it, as by this means the persecution of Protestants in
Catholic countries would receive a new impulse. But he was also
unwilling to express his refusal in a final shape, because he knew that
the wish to hinder the adoption of harsh measures against the Catholics
would exercise an influence upon the Spaniards in their negotiations
with him.<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a>
If he had proceeded to a prorogation, he would have been
obliged to reject the laws; and he preferred to keep the prospect of
them still open, which he was able to do by resorting to the form of an
adjournment. He made it a merit in the eyes of the Spaniards that, far
from increasing the severity of the penal laws, he did not even enforce
them in their existing form, when moreover, if enforced, they would
bring him in a large sum. But he was glad to see that people feared that
he might do at some future time what at present he had refrained from
doing. When he promised the Parliament on his royal word, that he would
call it together again without fail in the autumn, he was also
influenced by the consideration that he intended the Spaniards to look
forward with fear to the resolution which might then be taken. He was
greatly pleased that Parliament before dispersing drew up an energetic
remonstrance against the persecutions of the Protestants all over the
world, and especially against the oppression of his children. Not that
he wished to give effect to it: on the contrary he adhered to the policy
of assisting his son-in-law only by means of diplomacy: but he desired
that the Spaniards should fear a war with England, and he thought that
anxiety on this point would induce them and their friends to show
themselves conciliatory and respectful.</p>

<p>Sir John Digby, who was commissioned with the negotiations at the
Spanish court, was referred by that power to Brussels
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</a></span>
and Vienna; and in fact he received favourable answers, not only from the Infanta
Isabella in the former, but even from the Emperor himself in the latter
city. The Emperor held out to him the hope that the matter would be
reconsidered at a future assembly of the Estates of the Empire, which he
intended to convene at Ratisbon. But meanwhile warlike operations and
the execution of the ban held their course undisturbed. In Bohemia the
counter-reformation was carried through with extreme severity.
Four-and-twenty Protestant nobles and leaders were executed, and their
heads with hoary beards were seen exposed on the Bridge at Prague.
Silesia hastened to make its peace with the Emperor: the Princes of the
Union laid down their arms, but they did not yet make their peace by
this means. Tilly took possession of the Upper Palatinate, and then
turned with his victorious army to the Lower Palatinate in order to
complete the subjugation of this province, notwithstanding all the
protection of England. On the Lower Rhine the forces of the Spaniards
and of the States General confronted each other in arms. Under these
circumstances the Princes, who were invited, refused to appear at an
Assembly of the Empire,<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a>
for none of them thought that he could
leave his home without incurring evident danger. The Infanta Isabella
too in Brussels declined to conclude the truce which Sir John Digby
proposed.</p>

<p>While affairs were in this position, Parliament resumed its interrupted
sittings in November 1621. Dean Williams, who after Bacon's fall had
received the Great Seal, opened the session with a request for the
immediate grant of new subsidies, which he said would be required even
before Christmas. He promised that in the coming February, when they
resumed their sittings, the other affairs should be brought under
discussion.<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</a></span>
On this occasion as on a previous one, the King wished for nothing more
than a renewed and stronger demonstration. Even now he lived and moved
in a policy of compromise between opposite views. While his son-in-law
was being robbed of his country in the interest of Spain, he adhered to
the wish of marrying his son to a Spanish Infanta: he thought that he
would bring about the restoration of the Palatinate most easily by the
influence which this new alliance would confer. But he thought that his
friendly advances should also be accompanied by threats, and he wished
to be placed by the grants of Parliament in a position to arm more
effectually than before. It would have been in accordance with his
views, if Parliament had repeated its former declarations, according to
which it was ready to put forth all its power in his behalf, in order to
place him in a position to compel by force of arms what might be refused
to his peaceful negotiations.</p>

<p>It is worth noticing in all this that James not only met the wishes of
Parliament because he required support, but that he also encouraged the
disposition which it showed in favour of Protestantism, in order to
avail himself of it: he thought that he would always be able to control
it. But how often has a policy been shipwrecked, which has thought to
avail itself of great interests and great passions for some end
immediately in view!</p>

<p>How could it be expected that while religious parties on the continent
were meeting in a struggle for life and death, the English Parliament
would approve of the wavering policy of James I, which aimed at
compromise and had hitherto been without
results?<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a>
Quite the contrary: starting with the view that England was the centre of
Protestantism and must avert the dangers which assailed it, Parliament
declared itself ready, it is true, to pay the King new subsidies, but
not until the following year, and on the presumption that he should have
accepted and ratified the bills for the welfare
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</a></span>
of the people which had passed the
House.<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a>
They thought that the common danger to religion
arising from the alliance between the Pope and the King of Spain had
been brought upon England also by the indulgence hitherto shown to the
recusants. Parliament invited the King to draw the sword without further
circumlocution for the rescue of the foreign Protestants; in the first
instance to break with the power whose army had carried on the war in
the Palatinate, but above all to marry the Prince his successor to a
lady of the Protestant faith.</p>

<p>The King wished to avoid war because he was anxious lest he should be
constantly compelled by Parliament, owing to his repeated want of
subsidies, to make fresh concessions, which would affect and diminish
the substance of his authority. The Parliament wished for war because it
expected that such a proceeding would furnish it with great
opportunities for establishing its power.</p>

<p>As soon as the rival powers encountered each other on this ground, all
agreement between them was at an end. Parliament interfered still more
vigorously than before with the affairs which the King reserved for
himself: it wished to induce him to adopt those very measures which he
was resolved to avoid. He was expected to break with that power with
which it was his principal ambition to become most closely connected. He
was expected to take the sword in order to defend the common cause of
Protestantism. He was expected to put an end to the indulgence which he
had hitherto shown to his Catholic subjects; to do what ran counter to
all the expectations which he had raised at Rome and Madrid; and what
perhaps, considering the strength of the Catholic element in England,
was not without danger to the maintenance of quiet at home. Meanwhile
the payment of the subsidies, which he required at once in order to
maintain his political position, was indefinitely deferred. Although it
was not actually stated, yet it was quite clear that Parliament made the
validity of its grants dependent on his compliance with its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</a></span>
advice. And on what important matters was that advice offered! The King complained
that his prerogative was openly infringed by it; that Parliament wished
to decide on his alliances with other sovereigns, and to dictate to him
how to conduct the war; that it brought under debate questions of
religion and state, and the marriage of his son: what portion of the
sovereign power, he asked, was left to him? On the competence which
Parliament claimed as its hereditary right, he remarked that it had to
thank the favour of his ancestors and himself for this: that he would
protect Parliament, but only in proportion to the regard which it showed
for the prerogative of his crown.</p>

<p>If we had to specify the moment in which the quarrel between the
Parliament and the Crown once more found its full expression, we should
choose this.<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a>
The Parliament, which had dissolution in immediate
prospect, employed its last moments in making a protest, in which it
again affirmed that its liberties and privileges were a birthright and
heirloom of the subjects of the English crown, that it certainly was
within its power to bring under debate public matters affecting the
King, the State, the Church, and the defence of the country; and that
full liberty of speech without any subsequent molestation on that
account must be secured to every member in the exercise of these rights.</p>

<p>The King would not forego the satisfaction of punishing by arrest a
number of members who were peculiarly hateful to him; he declared the
protestation null and void, and struck it out of the clerks' book with
his own hand. In a detailed exposition of his view of these
transactions, in which he gives the assurance that he will still
henceforth continue to summon Parliament, he emphatically repudiates
this protestation, which he affirms to be drawn up in such terms that
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</a></span>
inalienable rights of the crown are called in question by it,
rights in the possession of which the crown had found itself in the
times of Queen Elizabeth of glorious memory. He affirms that as King he
cannot tolerate any such pretensions.</p>

<p>Parliament demanded the policy of Queen Elizabeth; King James demanded
her rights. The privileges accorded to the crown and the opposition to
Spain had formerly gone together: the surrender of the latter under King
James served to supply Parliament on its part with a motive for making
an attack upon the former.</p>

<p>The cause of Parliament was of great importance, even when it stood
alone: deeper impulses and fresh life and vigour were first imparted to
it by its combination with foreign policy and with religion. </p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class='centersm'><a name="BV_IV" id="BV_IV"></a>
NEGOTIATIONS FOR THE MARRIAGE OF THE PRINCE OF WALES WITH A SPANISH
INFANTA.</p>

<p>It is a general consequence of the dynastic constitution of the states
of Europe that marriages between the reigning families are at the same
time political transactions, and as a rule not only affect public
interests, but also stir up the rivalry of parties: this effect however
has hardly ever come more prominently into notice than when it was
proposed to marry the heir to the throne of England with an Infanta of
Spain.</p>

<p>We have remarked that the scheme originated in Spain, had already been
once rejected, and then had been mooted a second time by the leading
minister of Philip III, the Duke of Lerma. It formed part of Lerma's
characteristic idea of fortifying the greatness of the Spanish monarchy
by a dynastic alliance with the two royal families which were able to
threaten it with the greatest danger, those of France and England. This
design brought him into contact with a current of policy and personal
feeling in England which was favourable to him: but at the same time the
great difficulty which the difference of religion presented, came at
once into prominence. Not that it would have been difficult for King
James to make the concessions requisite for obtaining the Papal
dispensation; on the contrary he was personally inclined to do so: but
he feared unpleasant embarrassments with his allies and with his
subjects. Count Gondomar, the ambassador, assured the King that he
should never be pressed to do anything which violated his conscience or
<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1622.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[Pg 510]</a></span>
his honour, or by which he might run a risk of losing the love of his
people.<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a></p>

<p>On this, negotiations which had already been opened for the marriage of
the Prince with a French princess were broken off. Besides, the
intermarriage with the house of Spain appeared to be far more deserving
of preference, as being likely to pacify the feelings of English
Catholics, who were accustomed to side principally with Spain, and even
to promote the calm of the world, as Spain was a more prominent
representative of the Catholic principle than France. It was thought
advisable to leave the conditions of the dispensation to be arranged in
the sense indicated by negotiation between the Papal see and the Spanish
crown.</p>

<p>But a new and serious hindrance now arose in consequence of the
embarrassments caused by the affairs of the Palatinate, in which the
interests of the two dynasties came into immediate collision with one
another. It is clear that King James could not marry his son to an
Infanta of Spain while a Spanish army was taking possession of his
son-in-law's territory. He therefore made the restoration of the
Palatinate a condition of the marriage. All his tortuous efforts were
directed to combine the latter object with the former, and at the same
time to avoid a disadvantageous reaction upon his domestic policy.</p>

<p>While he invoked the Protestant sympathies of Parliament in order to
give weight to his demands, he nevertheless checked them again as soon
as he was in danger of being forced to make war, or even to resume the
measures against the Catholics, which might displease the Spanish court.
Whilst he made the Spaniards aware that if he were refused the
consideration he required, he would throw himself entirely into the
hands of his Parliament and proceed to extremities, he at the same time
employed every means of effecting a peaceful accommodation, by which he
would then at once be saved the necessity of making concessions to
Parliament.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[Pg 511]</a></span>
The most active negotiations were opened in Brussels with
the Infanta Isabella, upon whom the issue seemed most to depend. James I
had sent thither Richard Weston, the man whom Gondomar himself declared
to be the most appropriate instrument for this affair; and an agreement
was concluded with the personal co-operation of the Infanta, which held
out expectations of the restoration of the Elector. On the side of the
Palatinate and England everything was done to promote the conclusion of
this agreement, and to ensure its execution. The expelled Elector was
induced to recall Mansfeld and Christian of Brunswick from the Upper
Rhine, where they were then moving vigorously forward, lest the treaty
should be obstructed by their
operations.<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a>
He himself removed to
Sedan, in order not to arouse the suspicions of the House of Austria by
his residence in the Netherlands. In the summer of 1622 he had no other
troops in the Palatinate but the English garrisons; and King James
engaged that, if the treaty were concluded, he would take arms himself
against the allies of his son-in-law. But while expectation was directed
to the conclusion of the contract by which the Elector should be
re-established in his country, the League advanced against those
strongholds which the English held in his name. Neither Heidelberg nor
Mannheim could hold out. The English troops were obliged to bend to
necessity and to march out, although with the honours of war. Only in
Frankenthal did they still maintain themselves for a while. When Weston
at Brussels complained of this conduct he was actually told that the
League must have everything in their hands first, in order to restore
everything hereafter. He was astounded at this subterfuge, and asked for
his recall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</a></span>
In England the friends of Spain fell into a sort of despair at the
course of events. For what could follow from it but open war between the
King of England and the Emperor? But on whose side would Spain then be
found? Would that power pledge itself to fight to the end against every
one, even against the Emperor, in behalf of the treaty when concluded?
To prevent England from coming into closer alliance with France, the
government of Spain had planned the marriage and opened direct
negotiations: would it now, when its cause appeared to be advancing,
withdraw in violation of its word of honour? Even the Privy Council
represented to the King that he was bringing dishonour and danger on his
country. The Duke of Buckingham, who also had himself been in close
agreement with Gondomar, and was considered to be the man who held the
threads of politics in his hand, regarded the increasing discontent as
dangerous to his own
position.<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a></p>

<p>While affairs were in this situation and these impressions afloat, a
plan for bringing this uncertainty to an end was embraced by the King,
the Prince, and the Duke, in those private discussions in which the
general course of affairs was decided. It was determined that the
Prince, accompanied by Buckingham, should visit Spain himself, in order
to bring about the marriage and arrange the conditions. None of the
Privy Councillors, not even Williams, who on other occasions was in
their intimate confidence, knew anything about this plan. It pleased the
King's sense of the romantic, that as he himself had formerly brought
home his newly married wife from the icy North, so now his son should in
person win the hand of his bride in the distant South. But however much
in earnest the King was in the matter, we learn that he still
contemplated the possibility of failure. He once said to the Duke of
Soubise, that if the marriage came to pass, he would take up the cause
of the Huguenots in alliance with Spain: but that if he did not succeed
in his design they might still reckon upon him, for that his son would
<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1623.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</a></span>
contract a marriage with a French princess, which would
procure him great influence at the French
court.<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a></p>

<p>On March 7, 1623, the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Buckingham arrived
in Madrid, with an escort including Cottington and Endymion Porter, both
of whom afterwards enjoyed great influence. Their arrival was not
altogether welcome to the ambassador in residence there, Digby, now Lord
Bristol, who would rather have retained this important business in his
own hands: but the Spanish court and the nation itself found a certain
satisfaction for their pride in the personal suit urged by the
heir-apparent of one of the most powerful kingdoms for the hand of the
younger Infanta.</p>

<p>At first the Prince of Wales could only see the Infanta as she drove
past along a sort of Corso in the Prado. He was then presented to her,
but the words which she was to use to him were written down for her
beforehand; for she was to receive him merely as a foreign prince
without any reference whatsoever to his suit. Some surprise was created
when the principal lady of the court one day condescended to say to the
Prince that the Infanta in conversation gave signs of an inclination for
him. In the country no doubt was felt that the marriage would come to
pass, and the prospect was welcomed with joy. Often did a 'Viva' resound
under the windows of the Prince. Lope de Vega dedicated some happily
expressed stanzas to him; and splendid shows were given in his
honour.<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a>
All that was now wanting was an agreement as to the
conditions.</p>

<p>This depended however in large part on the resolutions which might be
arrived at in England. Conditions affecting religion were laid before
King James, which he might certainly have hesitated to approve. It was
not only that the Infanta was to be indulged in the free exercise of her
religion&mdash;for how else could the consent of the Spanish clergy or a
dispensation from the Pope have been hoped for?&mdash;nor even that the
children born from this marriage were to be educated under her eyes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[Pg 514]</a></span>
for the first ten years of their life, for this seemed the natural privilege
of a mother: but the presumption that the children might become
Catholics involved wide consequences. It was stipulated that the laws
against Catholics should not apply to such children, nor prejudice their
succession. Still more displeasing however were some other articles of
general import, which were carefully kept back from the knowledge of the
public. They amounted to this:&mdash;that the laws against the Catholics
should no longer be carried into execution, and that the Councillors of
the sovereign should be pledged by an oath to abstain from enforcing
them.<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a>
The King met with some opposition to these articles in the
Privy Council. But he said that the question was not whether they were
advisable, but whether they were not necessary at a time when part of
the domain under dispute, and the Prince himself, were in the hands of
the Spaniards. And moreover they did not amount to a complete concession
to the wishes of the Catholics, for they spoke only of tolerating their
worship in private, not in public: the articles were in harmony with the
old ideas of the King. James solemnly swore to the first articles, on
July 20, in the presence of the Spanish ambassador; and immediately
after him the members of the Council took the same oath. The King alone
then pledged himself to carry out the second set of articles.</p>

<p>An extensive alteration had already taken place in the treatment of the
Catholics. Priests and recusants had been discharged from prison and
enjoyed full liberty. An injunction was issued to the preachers and to
the Universities to abstain from all invectives against the Papacy. Men
had to see individual preachers who transgressed these orders thrown
into prisons which had been just emptied. The families which openly
expressed their hitherto secret adherence to Catholicism were already
counted by hundreds. Then came these transactions. What was learnt of
the articles was enough to spread universal dismay among
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[Pg 515]</a></span>
the Protestants, but they expected yet worse things. They thought they saw a
pronounced Catholic tendency becoming ascendant in the conduct of
affairs. An universal danger seemed to be hanging over the religion
which they professed. Every one hastened to church to pray against it;
the churches had never been more crowded. The second ecclesiastic in the
country, the Archbishop of York, put the King in mind that by his
project of toleration he was encouraging doctrines which he had himself
proved in his writings to be superstitious and idolatrous. At this time
moreover religious profession and political freedom were most closely
connected: all these penal laws which the King was removing had been
passed in Parliament, and were the work of the legislative power as a
whole. The Archbishop reminded the King in conclusion that when he
annulled the statutes of parliament by royal proclamation, he created an
impression that he thought himself at liberty to trample on the laws of
the land.<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a></p>

<p>The wishes of the King did not lean so decidedly in that direction as
people assumed. Buckingham and the Prince, who recommended him to take
the oath, remarked to him, among other observations, that his promise
that Parliament should repeal the penal laws against the Catholics
within three years would be fulfilled, if he merely exerted himself to
the extent of his strength for that object, even if it should prove
impossible to attain
it.<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a>
In general everything was merely
preliminary, and depended on further agreement. The Prince entreated his
father to transmit to him the ratification of the articles, that he
might decline them or not according to circumstances. He even wished
that, in order to put an end to the dilatoriness of the Spaniards, his
father should make an express declaration that any longer delay would
compel him again to enforce the penal laws against the
Catholics.<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a>
All these announcements, which filled the Catholics with joy and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[Pg 516]</a></span>
hope, but the Protestants with dejection, mistrust, and anxiety, were however
only political agencies, and were intended to serve a definite end. The
object was in the first instance to put an end by this means to all
delay in sending the Infanta to England.</p>

<p>Although some religious scruples were still awake in the minds of the
Spaniards yet they presented no further obstacle. The conditions for
granting a dispensation which had been prescribed by the Pope to the
Spanish Court, had been accepted; the Spanish ambassadors had been
satisfied: the only question now was whether the Infanta should be
conveyed to England at once with the Prince on his return, or in the
following spring. As formerly the Tudors so now the Stuarts appeared to
be taking their position as a dynasty in Europe in connexion with the
Spanish monarchy.</p>

<p>Only one difficulty remained, that connected with the Palatinate; but at
the present moment it was more serious than ever.</p>

<p>In his negotiations King James started with the supposition, that the
Spanish court could control the Imperial, and bring it over to its own
point of view. The inclusion of the German line in this dynastic
combination was contemplated. A proposal was made that the eldest son of
the expelled Frederick should contract a marriage with a daughter of the
Emperor, which would make the task of reconciliation and restitution far
easier.</p>

<p>The Emperor however had to take other interests into consideration; not
only those of the Duke of Bavaria, to whom he was so deeply pledged, but
those of the whole Catholic party, which thought of seizing this
occasion to establish for ever its ascendancy in the Empire. The
Emperor, who was also instigated by Rome to this step, solemnly
transferred the electoral dignity previously held by the Elector
Palatine to Maximilian of Bavaria in February 1623, with the intention
of satisfying him, and at the same time of obtaining a majority of
Catholic votes in the electoral body. It has indeed been assumed, both
then and at a later time, that Spain, only bent on deceiving England,
had agreed to all these proceedings. But in fact the Spanish ambassador
had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[Pg 517]</a></span>
opposed them most strenuously at Ratisbon in the name of his king,
as well as in that of the Infanta
Isabella.<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a>
He prophesied with accurate foresight new and inextricable embarrassments as the
consequence. The Papal Nuncio complained that the resistance of the
ambassador weakened the Catholics and emboldened the Protestants. But
his remonstrance had no effect on the Emperor. After his previous
experiences Ferdinand II had no more fear of his adversaries, least of
all of King James, who would certainly not in his old age make his first
appearance as a warrior and try the doubtful fortune of war. He thought
besides that he always consulted his security best when he had nothing
before his eyes but the advantage of the Catholic Church.</p>

<p>The negotiation about these matters took place just at the time when the
Prince of Wales was in Spain. There no one despaired of finding an
arrangement with which the Prince could still be satisfied. It was
thought that, when the Palsgrave Frederick had been reconciled with the
Emperor, and admitted into his family, the electoral dignity might be
enjoyed in turn by Bavaria and the Palatinate, or that a new electorship
might be founded for Bavaria. The Imperial ambassador, Count
Khevenhiller, however rejected these proposals, for no other reason than
that King James was not the proper person to make arrangements for his
grandson. He did not accept the supposition that the youth, whose
education it was proposed to complete in Vienna, would join the Catholic
faith, for he said that his mother would never allow that. He set aside
the expectation that the Imperial court might send to Spain a full
authorisation to negotiate for the marriage. He moreover affirmed that,
if the Imperial court wished to secure its influence in Germany, it
could not allow the opinion to gain ground that it depended on Spain and
was guided by her.</p>

<p>And in Spain also, after the fall of Lerma, which was brought on by this
affair, the old aspirations after the supremacy of the world had again
obtained the upper hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[Pg 518]</a></span>
It is true that at the moment a feeling prevailed in favour of
maintaining peace on the very advantageous footing which had then been
obtained. Cardinal Zapata, Don Pedro of Toledo, and above all Count
Gondomar, who had at that time been made a member of the Council,
declared before that body that Spain ought to have no higher political
aim than to secure her union with England. These were men of experience
in European affairs, who recollected the evils which had sprung from the
policy of Philip II. But there were others who were again seized with
the old ambition, so interwoven with Catholicism, and who would not
separate themselves from the interests of the Emperor at any price&mdash;men
like the Marquis de Aytona, Don Augustin Mexia. And Count Olivarez,
under the influence of the Imperial ambassador, now espoused the same
opinion, a man who, as favourite of the King and chief minister, filled
the same position in Spain that Buckingham did in England. At the
decisive meeting of the Council, he stated that the King of Spain would
not venture to separate from the Emperor, even if he had been mortally
affronted by him: if he could stand in friendly relations with the
Emperor and the King of England at the same time, well and good; but if
not, he must break with the King of England without any regard to the
marriage: this step was demanded of him for the preservation of
Christendom, of the Catholic religion, and of his family. He added that
a marriage between the young Count Palatine and a daughter of the
Emperor was only to be thought of, if the former became a Catholic: that
the complete restoration of the father was by no means advisable; and
that he ought to be dealt with as the Duke of Saxony had been dealt with
by Charles V.<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a>
Olivarez carried the Council with him in favour of
this policy. The strictly Catholic point of view, which had been
asserted by the German line of the house of Austria, was again adopted
as the rule of policy in Spain.</p>

<p>This was a resolution that decided the destinies of Spain. That power
again renounced the policy of compromise which it had observed for a
quarter of a century. The young King
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[Pg 519]</a></span>
Philip IV and his ambitious
favourite revived the designs of Philip II, or, as the former once
expressed it, of Charles V: to the restoration of Catholic ascendancy in
Germany they sacrificed the friendship of King James, which was of
inestimable advantage to the monarchy, inasmuch as it kept the coasts of
Spain free from all danger of attack from the English
forces.<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a>
Olivarez was too violent, too young, and too ill-informed to have any
clear conception of the influence of these relations.</p>

<p>But as in great transactions every step has consequences, it is clear
that the Spanish predilections of King James, and the policy founded on
them, were thus brought to an end. For maintaining these it was
necessary not only that they should be advantageous to the Catholics in
England, but that they should be equally serviceable to the Protestant
interests in Germany, which in the present instance were his own:
otherwise he would never have found rest again in his own country, or
his own family, or perhaps even in his own breast. He had asked for the
reinstatement of his son-in-law in the electorship as well as in the
possession of his hereditary dominions, or at least for the hearty
assistance of Spain in effecting this
object.<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a>
And the Prince of Wales shared these views. He once said to Count Olivarez that, without
the restoration of the Elector Palatine, the marriage was impossible,
and the friendship of England could not be expected. The Spaniards did
not think fit to impart to him the resolution which had been taken in
the Council of State; but still this implied a new direction given to
the course of affairs which could be followed although it was not talked
of. The Spaniards contented themselves with dwelling on the necessity of
sending the youthful Count Palatine to Vienna for education: as to his
father, who was under the ban, they held out indeed a prospect of the
restoration of his dominions but not of his electoral dignity. The
Prince declared that it was not to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[Pg 520]</a></span>
be imagined that his brother-in-law
would be content with that and would agree to
it.<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a>
And how was even as much as this to be obtained from the court of Vienna? It was now
certain that in the affair of the Palatinate Spain would not interfere
with decision. But besides this, the resolutions which had been taken in
the Spanish Council of State must lead to much wider consequences.</p>

<p>The miscarriage of the negotiations has been ascribed to the
misunderstanding between Olivarez and Buckingham; and it is no wonder
that such a misunderstanding arose, for the latter was conceited and
irritable, the former imperious and assuming. But these causes are only
of a secondary character; the root of the failure lies in the political,
or in the combination of the religious with the political relations of
the two countries. While in England Protestantism was moving in a
direction opposed to the intentions of King James, and could hardly be
held down, it was met by the Catholic interest in Spain and Germany,
which was fully conscious of its position. Now these were the powerful
elements which divided the whole world: the strife between them could
not be adjusted by political considerations.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to state further how Buckingham, who regarded the
somewhat unmeaning delays of the Spaniards as affronts, and who would
have had reason to fear for his authority in England in the event of his
prolonged absence, now urged the return of the Prince. Charles concurred
with him: King James, who moreover was impatient, as he said, to see the
two men whom he most loved about him again, commanded it; and the
Spanish court could not object.</p>

<p>Yet no estrangement arose in consequence, nor was the proposal for the
marriage withdrawn. The Infanta was treated as Princess of Wales; and
Philip IV in a letter once styled the Prince of Wales his
brother-in-law. The Papal dispensation, for which they had long been
kept waiting, at last arrived; and the marriage ceremony might have been
performed any day. The other negotiations also still kept advancing.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[Pg 521]</a></span>
King James then once more demanded an express declaration with regard to
the affair of the Palatinate. He wished to know what Spain thought of
doing if the Emperor refused to accede to the agreement that was to be
made between the two powers. The answer of the Spaniards was evasive:
how could it have been otherwise? But the English would not advance
further without better security. The Prince sent to request the
ambassador not to use the full powers, which he already had in his
hands, until he received fresh
orders.<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a>
King James declared that the
marriage could not be solemnised till the Spanish court consented to
take upon itself obligations with regard to the Palatinate.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class='centersm'><a name="BV_V" id="BV_V"></a>
THE PARLIAMENT OF 1624. ALLIANCE WITH FRANCE.</p>

<p>After the Prince had taken leave of his Spanish escort, and had gone on
board an English fleet at Santander, whither it had put in to fetch him
away, contrary winds, or, in the words of a contemporary narrative, 'the
brothers Boreas and Eurus,' for a while delayed his departure. We are
assured that people in England never regarded the weathercocks and the
direction of the smoke and of the clouds with more painful anxiety than
at that time. Even among the dependents of the royal house many almost
gave up the Prince as lost; for who, they said, could trust the word of
the Spaniards? The Protestant part of the population thought that he
would at least be compelled to abjure his religion. At last the wind
subsided. On October 5, after an absence of almost eight months, the
Prince arrived in Portsmouth, and the day after in London. The universal
joy with which he was received was indescribable: all business was at a
standstill; the shops were shut; nothing was seen but waggons driving
backwards and forwards, laden with the wood intended for the bonfires
which blazed at evening in all the open squares, at all corners of the
streets, even in the inner courts, but were most brilliant and costly at
the Guildhall.<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a>
The joyful acclamations of the multitude mingled
with the sound of the bells; people congratulated each other that the
heir to the throne had returned as he had gone, and that without the
Infanta; for this marriage had never been popular; but above all, that
he returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[Pg 523]</a></span>
rather confirmed than shaken in his religion. They praised
God for his deliverance out of the land of Egypt. Even Buckingham, who
was not loved at other times, enjoyed a moment of universal popularity.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the effect which would have been most welcome to the
majority, that of banishing all thoughts of an alliance with Catholic
powers, and of causing a wife to be sought for the Prince among
Protestants, was certainly not produced, for the King had long been
revolving another plan. The combination with Spain, although it had best
corresponded to his wishes and ideas, had nevertheless been only an
experiment: when it miscarried, he was predisposed to return to the
thought of an alliance with France. The Prince, on his way through
France, had already seized the opportunity of seeing the Princess, his
possible bride, while she was dancing, without being remarked by her;
and the impression which she made upon him had been by no means
unfavourable.</p>

<p>Instantly on his return from Spain Buckingham opened communications with
Mary de' Medici, Queen of France, and that through means of a Franciscan
monk, who could not be suspected, and who presented himself to her while
she was at dinner. Buckingham made secret overtures to her, intimating
that he wished to resume the old negotiations for an alliance between
the royal families of England and France, for that he was a Frenchman at
heart.<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a>
As the Queen expressed herself favourably inclined, Henry
Rich, who then bore the title of Lord Kensington, and afterwards that of
Lord Holland, was sent before the end of the year 1623 on a secret
mission to France in order to set the affair in motion. Rich was one of
the most intimate friends of Buckingham, and to a certain extent
resembled him in character.</p>

<p>In this affair Buckingham had two circumstances in his favour. It was
the main ambition of the Queen-mother to see her daughter on the throne
of the neighbouring kingdom. The preference accorded by the English
court to an Infanta of Spain over a daughter of France had had
<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1624.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[Pg 524]</a></span>
a painful effect upon her: she was the more gratified when that court now
resumed the negotiations which had been broken off. Nevertheless she did
not embark on so delicate an affair, the failure of which was still
possible, without the necessary reserve. The French court could not but
ask for religious concessions in favour of the Princess, as Spain had
for the Infanta: but on the very first approach to the subject it hinted
that it would not urge the King to such strict pledges as had been
demanded on the side of the
Spaniards.<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a>
The second influence in
Buckingham's favour was the political. The advance of the alliance, and
of the power of the Spaniards, especially their establishment in the
Palatinate, aroused the jealousy of the French. The opinion, which
Cardinal Richelieu so often emphatically expressed, that France,
everywhere enclosed by the power of the Spaniards, might some day be
prostrated by it, was generally held. The interests of his country
seemed to be deeply interested when England, from whose close connexion
with Spain the greatest danger was to be apprehended, separated herself
from that power, and showed a disposition to adopt a policy in harmony
with that of France. Henry Rich assures us that so universal an
agreement had never been known among Frenchmen as was shown at that time
in the wish to ally themselves with England. Already agents of Mansfeld
and Brunswick were seen at Court: an intended mission to Maximilian of
Bavaria was given up on the representation of the English ambassador.
Envoys from the expelled King of Bohemia also soon arrived, in order to
gain the co-operation of the French in his restoration. The negotiations
with England actually began: they were directed to an alliance and a
marriage at the same time: in each case it was made a preliminary
condition that England should openly and completely break with Spain.</p>

<p>But this condition could not be fulfilled in England quite easily and
without opposition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[Pg 525]</a></span>
And how indeed could it have been expected that the members of the Privy
Council, who had followed the King in the direction given to his policy
in favour of Spain, if not without any reserve, yet with an ardour which
might be turned to their reproach, would now, as it were, turn round,
and follow the example of the favourite in entering on another path? A
commission chosen from their body was appointed in order to take into
consideration the complaints made by Buckingham about the behaviour of
the Spanish court. But the report which Buckingham made was by no means
so convincing as to win their concurrence. He rather depended on
impressions, which had no doubt in his own eyes a certain truth, than on
facts which might have served as evidence for others as well. The
commission declared itself almost unanimously against
him.<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a>
Its sentence was, that Philip IV had seriously intended to marry his sister
to the Prince; and that in the affair of the Palatinate he had behaved,
if not as a friend, yet at any rate not as an enemy. The first part is
undoubtedly correct; with regard to the second however, neither the
members of the Privy Council had any suspicion, nor had Buckingham
himself any real information, that the Spaniards had made the interests
of Austria in the Palatinate so decidedly their own. The Council was
moreover in an ill humour with the favourite on account of the arbitrary
authority which he arrogated to himself. When Lord Bristol came to
England in the beginning of the year 1624, and then laid all the blame
on Buckingham himself, a party was formed against the latter, which
sought to overthrow him, and was even thought to have already secured a
new favourite, with whom to replace Buckingham, just as he had formerly
stepped into the place of Somerset. It was remarked that the friends and
adherents of Somerset, who had always been on the side of Spain, came
together and bestirred themselves. It was clear, and was generally said,
that if relations with Spain were not broken off, the minister must
fall. As people expressed it, 'either the marriage must break or
Buckingham.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[Pg 526]</a></span>
In this danger Buckingham resolved on a step of the greatest
significance, in order to be able at once to attack the Spaniards, and
to meet his rivals at home. He turned to those who had for many years
demanded war with Spain on principle, the popular and zealous Protestant
party. The King assented to his request for the summoning of a new
Parliament, of which he had in fact for other reasons already given
notice. As was to be expected from the connexion of affairs, the result
of the elections corresponded with the views of the last Parliament. Men
like Coke, who had been called to account for their attitude at that
time, were re-elected two or three times over. The ruling minister now
regarded them even as his allies.</p>

<p>What an indescribable advantage however for the supporters of the claims
of Parliament was this change! As the ill-success of the German policy
of the King in the year 1621 had turned to their advantage, so now they
profited by the failure of his negotiations with Spain. The political
leanings of James I in favour of Spain, which they had originally
opposed, had led to embarrassments in which the First Minister himself
invoked their aid.</p>

<p>But not only did party rivalries display themselves at this important
moment, but a general opposition also arose on constitutional grounds.
The Earl of Carlisle represented to the King that he had been visited by
members of Parliament, no mere popular leaders or speakers, but quiet
men and good patriots, who feared God and honoured the King: that he had
learned from them that the agitation observed in the country had
principally arisen because the last grants of Parliament had not been
met by any favours on the part of the King, but on the contrary the
expression of opinions displeasing to him on the part of certain members
had been subsequently punished by their arrest. Carlisle reminded the
King that nothing could be more hateful to his enemies, or more
strengthening and encouraging to his friends, than the removal of these
disagreements; that no king had ever had better subjects if he would but
trust them; that if he would but show them that he relied on their
counsel and support, he would win their hearts and command their
fortunes; and that the people would then work with him for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[Pg 527]</a></span>
welfare and honour of the
State.<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a></p>

<p>These views prevailed when Parliament was opened on the 19th of
February, 1624. Hitherto it had been one of the principal grievances of
the King that Parliament wished to have a voice in affairs that
concerned his state and his family. The new Parliament was opened with a
detailed account from Buckingham of his negotiations with Spain, which
affected both these interests, and with a request that Parliament would
report on the great questions awaiting
settlement.<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a></p>

<p>The answer of both Houses was, that it was contrary to the honour of the
King, to the welfare of his people, to the interest of his children, and
even to the terms of his former alliances, to continue the negotiations
with Spain any longer: they prayed him to break off negotiations on both
subjects, with regard to the Palatinate, as well as with regard to the
marriage. It was hailed as a public blessing that the conditions
accepted for the sake of the latter would not now be fulfilled.</p>

<p>At this moment Buckingham's wishes were on the side of this policy; for
otherwise he could not have advanced a step in his dealings with France.
But the King had not so fully made up his mind. He had approved the
overtures made to France: but when he was now asked to break with Spain,
the power which he most feared, and whose friendship it was the first
principle of his policy to cultivate, there was something in him which
recoiled from the step. Buckingham acknowledged for the first time that
he was not of the same mind with the King. He said that he wished to
tread only in one path, whereas the King thought that he could walk in
two different paths at once; but that the King must choose between the
Spaniards and his own subjects. He asked him whether, supposing that
sufficient subsidies of a definite amount were at once granted him, and
the support of his subjects with their lives and fortunes were promised
him for the future, so far as it might be necessary&mdash;whether
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[Pg 528]</a></span>
in that
case he would resolve to break off the matrimonial alliance with Spain.
He asked for a straightforward and definite answer, that he might be
able to give information on the subject beforehand to some members of
Parliament. It is evident that this was no longer the attitude of a
favourite, who has only to express the opinions and wishes of his
prince. Buckingham came forward as a statesman, who opposes his own
insight to the aims of his sovereign. He says that if he should concur
with the King, he should be a flatterer; that if he should fail to
express his own opinion, he should be a traitor. In this matter he could
rely on the support of the Prince, who, without estranging himself from
his father, still appeared to be less dependent on his will than
before.<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a>
The result was that James I again gave way. He named the
sum which he should require for the defence of his kingdom, for the
support of his neighbours, and for the discharge of his own debts.
Parliament, although it did not grant the whole amount demanded, yet
granted a very considerable sum: it agreed to pay three full subsidies
and three fifteenths within a year, if the negotiations were broken off.
At the beginning of April Buckingham was able to announce to Parliament
that the King, in consequence of the advice given to him, had finally
broken off negotiations with Spain on both matters.</p>

<p>Other and further concessions of the greatest extent were coupled with
this announcement. The King promised that, if a war should break out, he
would not entertain any proposals for peace without the advice of
Parliament. It was of still more importance, for the moment at least,
that he declared himself willing to allow Parliament itself to dispose
of the sums it had granted. He said that he wished to have nothing to do
with them: that Parliament itself might nominate a treasurer. These
likewise were admissions which Buckingham had demanded from the
King:<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a>
but it maybe supposed that he had a previous understanding on
the subject
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[Pg 529]</a></span>
with the leaders of the Parliament. He also represented to
the King that the removal of the old grievances was an absolute
necessity. The monopolies to which James had so long clung, and which he
had so obstinately defended, he now in turn gave up; while the penal
laws against the Catholics, to which he was averse, were revived.</p>

<p>This was an intestine struggle between the different powers in the
state, as well as a question of policy. Parliament and the favourite
made common cause against the Privy Council, which was on the side of
Spain.</p>

<p>Among his opponents in the Privy Council, Buckingham hated none so much
as the Lord Treasurer Cranfield, then Earl of Middlesex, for Cranfield,
although raised from a humble station by Buckingham himself, had the
courage to resist him on the Spanish
question.<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a>
By his strict and successful management of business, Cranfield had won the favour of the
King, who believed that he had found in him a second Sully. It seems
that Cranfield himself had intended to effect the ruin of Buckingham:
but Buckingham was too strong for him. Certain accusations, which were
partly well founded, were made available in bringing him to trial by
Parliamentary means, and in removing him from his office like Bacon; for
he had incurred the enmity of many by his strictness and
incorruptibility. The King professed to regard this case as even worse
than the former, because Bacon had acknowledged his guilt, while
Cranfield denied all guilt. The doctrine of the responsibility of
ministers was by this means advanced still further, for it was now
becoming more dangerous to fall out with Parliament than with the King.</p>

<p>The authority of Parliament in general made important strides. It now
threw paramount weight into those deliberations which concerned the
general affairs of the kingdom, war and peace, and the royal family.
What became of the principle on which the King had hitherto taken his
stand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[Pg 530]</a></span>
that the decision of these matters must be left exclusively to
his discretion? Parliament again assumed the attitude which three years
before had led to its dissolution.</p>

<p>It was not possible that James I could look on all this without
displeasure and uneasiness. Sometimes the thought occurred to him that
Buckingham had not been the right man to conduct the negotiations with
Spain. The words escaped him that, if he had sent the Lord Keeper
Williams with his son instead of Buckingham, his honour would then have
been saved, and his heart would now beat more lightly. He did not
approve of the decided turn which was being given to foreign politics.
He was once heard to say that he was a poor old man, who in former times
had known something about politics, but who now knew nothing more about
them.</p>

<p>It seems indeed that he had fancied that he could still continue to hold
the balance between parties: so at least those who knew James understood
him. He had no intention of allowing Buckingham's fall, as the enemies
of that nobleman wished, but he perhaps thought of finding a
counterpoise for him: he did not wish to let him become lord and master
of affairs. On the other hand Buckingham, by his connexion with the
leading men of the Lower House, had already won an independent position,
in which he was no longer at the mercy of the King. He may perhaps be
set down as the first English minister who, supported by Parliament and
by public opinion, induced or compelled the King to adopt a policy on
which of his own accord he would not have resolved. In conjunction with
his new friends Buckingham succeeded in breaking up the Spanish party,
with which he now for the first time came into conflict: his adherents
congratulated him on his
success.<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a>
In court and state a kind of
reaction against the previous importance of this party set in. The
offices which were vacated by the fall of Cranfield were conferred on
men of the other party, the kind of men who had formerly been displaced
under the influence of Gondomar.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[Pg 531]</a></span>
Seamen were acquitted who had shown
the same disregard for orders as Walter Ralegh had once done, and
preparations were made to indemnify Ralegh's posterity for the loss of
property which they had suffered. The Spanish ambassadors at court
availed themselves of a moment of ill humour on the part of the King, to
whom indeed they had again obtained access, to call his attention to the
loss of authority which threatened him on account of Buckingham's
combination with the leading men in the Parliament. But in what they
said they mingled so much falsehood with the truth that they could be
easily refuted; and Buckingham successfully resisted this attack also.</p>

<p>People still perceived in the King his old indecision. He consented, it
is true, that Mansfeld, whom he had formerly helped the Spaniards to
expel from his strong position on the Upper Rhine, should now be
supported by English as well as French money in a new campaign to
recover the Palatinate. But nevertheless he wished at the same time to
enjoin him as a condition to abstain from attacking any country which
rightfully belonged to the Archduchess Isabella, or to the crown of
Spain.<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a>
So far was he still from undertaking open war against Spain,
as his subjects hoped and expected.</p>

<p>And though he acceded to the negotiations with France, yet in this
transaction the very circumstance which displeased the majority of his
subjects&mdash;namely that he was hereby making an alliance with a Catholic
power&mdash;was acceptable to him. For even then he would not have consented
at any price to have interfered in the general religious quarrel merely
on religious grounds. He felt no hesitation in promising the French, as
he had the Spaniards, not only freedom of religion in behalf of the
future queen, but even relief for his Catholic subjects in regard to the
penal laws imposed by Parliament. Yet he could have wished that they had
contented themselves with his simple promise. One of his envoys, Lord
Nithisdale, was himself of this opinion. On the other side it was
remarked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[Pg 532]</a></span>
that perhaps the Catholics, of whom he also was one, might be
contented with a promise from their sovereign, on whom their whole
welfare depended, but that the French government could not, as it must
have a dispensation from the Pope, which could not be obtained without a
written assurance. James I at first declared himself ready to give such
a declaration in a letter to the king of France, and La Vieuville, who
was minister at the time, expressed himself content with that. But after
his fall and Richelieu's accession to power this arrangement was
rejected. It was in vain that the King's ambassadors held out a prospect
that the letter should be signed by the Prince and by the chief
Secretary of State; the French insisted that the King should ratify not
only the treaty, but also a special engagement which they themselves
wished to frame and to lay before Urban VIII. The English
plenipotentiaries at the French court, Holland and Carlisle, were still
refusing to agree to this, when King James had already given way to the
French ambassador in England.</p>

<p>The agreement, in the form in which it was at last concluded, was in
some points more advantageous for England than that with Spain had been.
While the latter stipulated that the laws which had been passed, or
might hereafter be passed, in England against the Catholics were not to
be applied to the royal children, but that these on the contrary were
still to be secured in their right to the succession, an agreement
which, as was mentioned, opened a prospect of an alteration in the
religion of the reigning family; this supposition was avoided in the
contract with France. But it was agreed on the other hand that the
future queen was to conduct the education of her children, not merely
till their tenth year, as had been stipulated with Spain, but till their
thirteenth. She herself and her household were also to enjoy a higher
degree of ecclesiastical independence; the superintendence of a bishop
was even allowed them. It was the ambition of the Pope to demand not
much less from the French than his predecessor had demanded from the
Spaniards as the price of bestowing a dispensation for the marriage of a
Catholic princess with a Protestant prince; and it was the ambition of
the French court to offer him, or at least to appear to offer him, no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[Pg 533]</a></span>
less. In the special assurance above mentioned James gave a promise that
his Catholic subjects should look forward to the enjoyment of still
greater freedom than that which would have been conferred on them by the
agreement with Spain. They were not to be molested for the sake of
religion, either in their persons or in their possessions, supposing
that in other respects they conducted themselves as good and loyal
subjects.<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a></p>

<p>The English ambassadors took exception to single expressions: the King
himself passed lightly over them. He was mainly induced to do so by the
absence from the agreement with France of the most offensive and
burdensome clauses which had been contained in the secret articles of
the treaty with Spain. On December 12, 1624, the treaty was signed at
Cambridge by the King, and the special assurance both by the King and by
the Prince.</p>

<p>James I wished to see his son married. At the Christmas immediately
following he greeted him according to English fashion with the tenderest
expressions: he said that he existed only for his sake; that he had
rather live with him in banishment than lead a desolate life without
him. He thought that the treaty of marriage which had just been
concluded would establish his happiness for ever.</p>

<p>An alliance between France and England for the recovery of the
Palatinate was now moreover in contemplation. From the first moment the
French had acknowledged that this would be to their own interest, and
had promised to assist in that object to the extent of their power.
Nevertheless they hesitated to conclude an express agreement for this
object; for what would the Pope say if they allied
<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1625.</span>
themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[Pg 534]</a></span>
with Protestants against Catholics? At last they submitted a declaration in
writing, but this appeared to the English ambassadors so unsatisfactory,
that they preferred to return it to them. The French said that this time
they would perform more than they promised. Although exceptions of many
kinds might be made to their performances, yet they were really
seriously bent on doing as much as possible for the recovery of the
Palatinate. Just at that time Richelieu had stepped into power, and he
expressly directed the policy of France to the destruction of the
position which the Spaniards had occupied on the Middle Rhine. In spite
of the obstructive efforts of a party which had both ecclesiastical and
political objects in view, he concluded the arrangements for the
marriage of the Princess to the Prince of Wales without any delay, even
without waiting for the last word of the Pope.</p>

<p>By this means the connexion which the King had formed in earlier years
seemed once more to be revived. The Duke of Savoy and the Republic of
Venice supported Mansfeld's preparations with subsidies of money. The
States General took the most lively interest in the warlike movements in
Germany, on which the Elector of Brandenburg also set his hopes. The
King of Denmark offered his help in the matter with a readiness which
created astonishment. While the English ambassadors were busy in
adjusting the disputes that were constantly springing up afresh between
him and Sweden, he gathered the estates of Lower Saxony around him, in
order to check the swift advance of the Catholic
League.<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a>
Of the members of the old alliance the princes of Upper Germany alone were
absent. It was hoped that the Union would be revived by the efforts of
Lower Germany, and above all that its head, the Elector Palatine, would
be restored to his country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[Pg 535]</a></span>
Induced by the failure of peaceful negotiations for the restoration of
his son-in-law, James allowed greater progress to be made in the
direction of war than he had ever done before. He took an eager interest
in the preliminaries and preparations for war, even for a naval war. But
would he ever have proceeded to action? While preparing to attack the
Emperor and the League did he intend to do anything more than make a
demonstration against Spain? In truth it may be doubted. He never
allowed his English troops to attempt anything for the relief of Breda,
which at that time was still blockaded by the
Spaniards.<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a></p>

<p>And in his alliance with France he certainly still held fast to his
original principles.</p>

<p>The marriage of his son to a Catholic princess, and the indulgence
towards the Catholics to which he thereby pledged himself, express the
most characteristic tendencies of his policy. Notwithstanding all the
concessions which he made to Parliament, he still refused to grant many
of the demands which were addressed to him. The special agreement which
he made with France corresponded to the conception which he had formed
of his prerogative. By means of it he imported into relations controlled
by the law of nations his claim to give by virtue of his royal power a
dispensation even from laws that had been passed by Parliament.</p>

<p>After, as well as before, this event his idea was to control and to
combine into harmony the conflicting elements within his kingdom by his
personal will; outside his kingdom, to guide or to regulate events by
clever policy. This is the important feature in the position and in the
pacific attitude of this sovereign. But the blame which attaches to him
is also connected with it. He made each and everything, however
important it might be in itself, merely secondary to his political
calculation. His high-flying thoughts have something laboured and flat
about them; they are almost too closely connected with a conscious, and
at the same time personal, end; they want that free sweep which is
necessary for enlisting the interest of contemporaries and of posterity.
And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[Pg 536]</a></span>
could the policy of James ever have prevailed? Was it not in its
own nature already a failure? A great crisis was hanging over England
when King James died (March 1625). He had once more received the Lord's
Supper after the Anglican use, with edifying expressions of contrition:
a numerous assembly had been present, for he wished every one to know
that he died holding the same views which he had professed, and had
contended for in his writings during his lifetime. </p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p class='centersm'><a name="BV_VI" id="BV_VI"></a>
BEGINNING OF THE REIGN OF CHARLES I, AND HIS FIRST AND SECOND
PARLIAMENT.</p>

<p>The prince who now ascended the throne was in the bloom of life: he had
just completed his twenty-fifth year. He had been weak and delicate in
childhood: among the defects from which he suffered was that of
stammering, which he did not get over throughout life; but he had grown
up stronger in other ways than had been expected. He looked well on
horseback: men saw him govern with safety horses that were hard to
manage: he was expert in knightly exercises: he was a good shot with the
cross-bow, as well as with the gun, and even learned how to load a
cannon. He was hardly less unweariedly devoted to the chase than his
father. He could not vie with him in intelligence and knowledge, nor
with his deceased brother Henry in vivacious energy and in popularity of
disposition; but he had learnt much from his father, at whose feet he
loved to sit; and his brother's tastes for the arts and for the
experimental sciences, especially the former, had passed to him. In
moral qualities he was superior to both. He was one of those young men
of whom it is said that they have no fault. His strict propriety of
demeanour bordered on maiden bashfulness: a serious and temperate soul
spoke from his calm eyes. He had a natural gift for apprehending even
the most complicated questions, and he was a good writer. From his youth
he shewed himself economical; not profuse, but at the same time not
niggardly; in all matters precise. All the world had been wearied by the
frequent proofs which his father had given of his untrustworthiness, and
by the unfathomable mystery in which he enveloped his ever-wavering
intentions: they expected from the son more openness, uprightness, and
consistency. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[Pg 538]</a></span>
asked if he would not also be more decidedly
Protestant. He showed, at least at first, that he had a more sensitive
feeling with regard to his princely
honour.<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a>
He had expected that his personal suit for the hand of the Infanta would remove all
difficulties on the part of the Spaniards, even those of a political
character, which obstructed the marriage. They had paid him every
attention suitable to his rank, but in the business which was under
discussion they had not given way a hair's breadth: it rather appeared
as if they wished to avail themselves of his presence to impose harder
conditions upon him. He was deeply affronted at this. When he found
himself again among his countrymen on board an English ship, he
expressed his astonishment that he had not been detained after he had
been so ill-treated.<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a>
Quiet and taciturn by nature, he knew while in
Spain how to disguise his real feelings by appearing to feel
differently: but we have seen how on his return his whole attitude with
regard to affairs in general, both foreign and domestic, in matters
which concerned his father and the Parliament alike, assumed an altered
character which corresponded to the general feeling of the nation far
more closely than the policy previously pursued.</p>

<p>In the last days of James doubts had still been felt whether he would
ever allow a marriage to take place between his son and a French
princess, and large sums had been wagered on the issue. Charles I at
once put an end to all hesitation. He did not allow himself to be
induced to defer his marriage even by the death of his father, or by a
pestilential sickness which then prevailed, or by the lack of the
desirable preparations in the royal palaces. He wished to show the world
that he adhered to his policy of opposition to Spain. He even allowed
the privateering, which his father had formerly suppressed with so much
zeal, to begin again. The royal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[Pg 539]</a></span>
navy, for the improvement of which
Buckingham actively exerted himself, was put in a complete state of
efficiency, and the money granted by Parliament was principally employed
for this purpose.</p>

<p>But to enable him to undertake war in earnest he required fresh grants.
It was almost the first thought of the King after his accession to the
throne to call a Parliament for this purpose, and that the same
Parliament which had last sat in the reign of his
father.<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a>
He bent, although unwillingly, to the necessity, imposed by the constitution, of
ordering new elections to be proceeded with, for he would rather have
avoided all delay: but he entertained no doubt that the Parliament, as
it was composed after the elections, would give him its full support.
After what had taken place he considered this almost a matter of course.</p>

<p>On June 18/28, 1625, Charles I opened his first Parliament at
Westminster. He reminded the members that his father had been induced by
the advice of the Parliament, whose wishes he had himself represented to
the King, to break off all further negotiations with Spain. He said that
this was done in their interest: that on their instigation he had
embarked on the affair as a young man joyfully and with good courage:
that this had been his first undertaking: what a reproach would it be
both for himself and for them if they now refused him the support which
he necessarily required for bringing to a successful issue the quarrel
which had already begun!</p>

<p>And certainly if war with Spain had been the only question, he might
have reckoned upon abundant grants: but the matter was not quite so
simple. Parliament thought above all of its own designs, which it had
not been possible to effect in the lifetime of James I, but which
Charles had advocated in the last session. If the new King inferred the
obligation of Parliament to furnish the money required for a foreign war
from the share it had had in the counsels which had led to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[Pg 540]</a></span>
that war, Parliament also considered that he was no less bound on his part to
fulfil the wishes that had been expressed in regard to internal policy.
In the very first debate which preceded the election of the Speaker,
this point of view was very distinctly put forward. The King was told
that in the last session he had sought to remove all differences between
Parliament and his father, and to induce the latter to grant the
petitions of Parliament: that if he had not succeeded then, that result
had been due only to his want of power; but now he had power as well as
inclination: what he before had only been able to will, he now was
enabled to effect, and everything depended solely on
him.<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a>
It had been especially the execution of the Acts of Parliament directed against
the Catholics which the Parliament demanded, and which the Prince in his
ardour against Spain had then thought advisable. His father had refused
to grant this: it was now expected that he should grant it himself. They
expected this from him as much as he expected from them a subsidy
sufficient for carrying on the war. It may be asked, however, whether it
was possible for him to give ear to their wishes. The complication in
his fortunes arose from his inability to comply.</p>

<p>If Charles I, when Prince of Wales, had wished to identify his cause
entirely with the aims of Parliament, he would have been obliged to
marry the daughter of a Protestant prince. But this was prevented by the
political danger which would then have arisen in the event of a breach
with Spain. Neither James nor Charles I believed that they could
withstand this great monarchy without an alliance with France. Political
and dynastic interests had led to the marriage which had just been
concluded. But by this a relation with the Catholic world had again been
contracted which rendered impossible a purely Protestant system of
government such as Queen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[Pg 541]</a></span>
Elizabeth desired to establish. A dispensation
from Rome had been required which expressed even without any disguise
the hope that the French princess would convert the King and his realm
to the old faith.<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a>
The marriage could not have been concluded
without entering into obligations which were in open contradiction to
the Acts of Parliament. Those obligations were not yet fully known, but
what was learnt of them caused great agitation. Charles was reminded of
a promise, which he was said to have given at an earlier time, to agree
to no conditions on his marriage which might be prejudicial to the
Church existing in England. Men asked how that promise had been
fulfilled; and why any secret was made of the compact which had been
concluded. Would not the Queen's chapel, they asked, now serve to unite
the Catholics of England; or would they be forbidden to hear mass there?
In a forcible petition Parliament asked for the execution of the laws
issued against Papists and
recusants.<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a></p>

<p>Charles I was not in a position to be able to regard it. It was not that
he had any thought of curtailing the rights of the English Church or of
entering on any other course in great questions of general policy than
that which had been laid down in conjunction with Parliament. His
marriage also was a preparation for the conflict with Spain; but if it
was not so decidedly opposed to the common feeling of the country as a
Spanish marriage, yet it was far from being in accordance with it. The
pledges which had been given on that occasion prevented the King from
adopting exclusively Protestant points of view, and from identifying
himself completely with his people.</p>

<p>But there was another reason for the King's adherence to his agreement.
He was as little inclined as his father had been to allow the Parliament
to exercise any influence on ecclesiastical affairs. Much unpleasant
surprise was created at that time by the writings of Dr. Montague, in
which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[Pg 542]</a></span>
treated the Roman Church with forbearance, and Puritanism with
scorn and hatred. Parliament wished to institute proceedings against the
author. The King did not take him under his protection; but on the
request of some dignitaries of the English Church he transferred the
matter to his own tribunal. He regarded it moreover as an undoubted
element of his prerogative to dispense with the statutes passed by
Parliament, so that the concessions which were expressed in the marriage
compact appeared to him quite justifiable.</p>

<p>We see how closely this affected the most important question of English
constitutional law. The universal competence of Parliament is here
opposed to the authority of the King, strengthened by his ecclesiastical
functions. And we understand how Parliament, in spite of the urgent need
created by itself, hesitated to fulfil the expectations of the King.</p>

<p>It could not absolutely refuse to make any grant: it offered him two
subsidies, 'fruits of its love' as they were termed. But the King had
expected a far stronger proof of devotion. What importance could be
attached to such an insignificant sum in prospect of so tremendous an
undertaking as a war against Spain? The grant itself implied a sort of
refusal.</p>

<p>But the Lower House also attempted to introduce a most extensive
innovation in regard to finance. The customs formed one of the main
sources of the revenue of the crown, without which it could not be
supported. They had been increased by the last government on the ground
of its right to tonnage and poundage, although, as we saw, not without
opposition.<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a>
The constitutional question was whether the customs
were properly to be regarded as a tax, and accordingly dependent on the
grant of Parliament, or whether they were absolutely appropriated to the
crown by right derived from long prescription: for since the time of
Edward IV, tonnage and poundage had been granted to every king for the
whole period of his reign. The controversies arising
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[Pg 543]</a></span>
on the subject under James had brought to light the daily increasing importance
conferred by the growth of commerce on this source of revenue, which
certainly assured to the crown, if not for extraordinary undertakings,
yet for the conduct of the ordinary business of the state, a certain
independence of the grants of Parliament. The Lower House was now
disinclined, both on principle and under the painful excitement of the
moment, to renew the grant on these terms: it therefore conferred the
right to tonnage and poundage on the King only for a year. But the
import of this restriction was plain enough. The popular leaders were
not satisfied with granting the King very inadequate support for the
war, but they sought to make him dependent even in time of peace on the
goodwill of the Lower House. The resolution was rejected by the Upper
House, and it appeared to the King himself as an affront. For why should
he be refused what had been secured to his predecessors during a century
and a half? The granting of supplies for life he regarded as a mere
form, which after such long prescription was not even necessary. He
thought himself entitled, even without such a grant, to have the duties
levied in his own name as before.</p>

<p>These were differences of the most thoroughgoing character, which had
descended to Charles I with the crown itself from the earlier kings and
from his father. The change of government, and certain previous
occurrences caused these differences to come into greater prominence
than ever; but they received their peculiar character from something in
his personal relations which had also been transmitted from the father
to the son.</p>

<p>Or rather, we may say, James I would certainly have been inclined to get
rid of Buckingham as he had formerly got rid of Somerset: under Charles
I this favourite occupied a still stronger position than he had held
before.</p>

<p>Between the two men personally there was a great contrast. In the
favourite there was nothing of the precision, calmness, and moral
behaviour of the King. Buckingham was dissolute, talkative, and vain.
His appearance had made his fortune, and he endeavoured to add to it by
a splendour of attire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[Pg 544]</a></span>
which later times would have allowed only in
women. Jewels were displayed in his ears, and precious stones served as
buttons for his doublet. It was affirmed that on his journey to France,
which preceded the marriage of the King, he had taken with him about
thirty different suits, each more costly than the last. It was for him
as much an affair of ambition as of sensual pleasure to make an
impression upon women, and to achieve what are called conquests in the
highest circles. He revelled in the enjoyment of successes in society.
Moments of lassitude followed, when those who had to speak with him on
business found him extended upon his couch, without giving them a sign
of interest or attention, especially when their proposals were not
altogether to his mind. Immediately afterwards however he would pass
from this state to one of the most highly-strained activity, for which
he by no means wanted ability: he then knew neither rest nor weariness.
He was spurred on most of all by the necessity of making head
alternately against such powerful and active rivals as the two ministers
who at that time conducted the affairs of France and Spain. He was bound
to Charles I by a common interest in one or two of those employments
which fill up daily life, for instance by fondness for art and art
collections, but principally by the companionship into which they had
been thrown, first in the cabinet of James I, who weighed his
conclusions by their assistance, and afterwards in their journey to
Spain. The Spaniards, who were accustomed to treat persons of the
highest rank with respect and reverence, were greatly scandalised to see
how entirely Buckingham indulged his own humours in the presence of the
Prince. He allowed himself to use playful nicknames, such as might have
been often applied in the hunting-seats of James or in letters to him,
but which at other times appeared very much out of place. He remained
sitting when the Prince was standing: in his presence he had indeed the
audacity to consult his ease by stretching his legs on another chair.
The Prince appeared to find this quite proper: Buckingham was for him
not so much a servant as an equal and intimate friend. It would have
been impossible to say which of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[Pg 545]</a></span>
two was the chief cause of the
alienation which arose between them and the Spaniards. Rumour made the
favourite responsible for this estrangement: better informed people
traced it to the Prince himself. The intimacy formed during their
previous association had been made still closer by the policy which they
pursued since their return from Spain. Many persons hoped
notwithstanding that, in spite of appearances to the contrary, an
alteration would take place with the change of government. But on the
first entry of Charles I into London, Buckingham was seen sitting by him
in his carriage in the usual intimate proximity. His share in the
marriage of the King increased their friendship: they both equally
agreed even in the subsequent change of policy. Buckingham had allied
himself most closely with the leaders of the Puritan opposition in
Parliament: by their support principally he had broken up the party
favourable to Spain. But in return for these services he had now not the
least intention of doing justice to their claims. If it had depended on
him, still greater concessions would afterwards have been granted in
favour of the Catholics than in fact were made; for Catholic sympathies
were very strongly represented in his family: he himself had far less
feeling in favour of Anglican orthodoxy than the King. And when the
rights of the prerogative were called in question, he again espoused
them most zealously, seeing that his own power rested on their validity.
He looked at the Parliamentary constitution from the point of view of a
holder of power, who wishes to avail himself of it for the end before
him without deeming himself bound by it, so soon as it becomes
inconvenient to him. He cared only for success in his immediate object:
all means of obtaining it seemed fair.</p>

<p>The continuance of the session in London was at that time rendered
impossible by the pestilential sickness already referred to, which every
day increased in severity. Buckingham, who although pliant and adroit
yet had no regard whatever for others, wished to keep Parliament sitting
until it had made satisfactory grants. While the members, and even the
Privy Council, wished for a prorogation, he urged with success that the
sitting should only be transferred to Oxford.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[Pg 546]</a></span>
Thither the two Houses
very unwillingly went, for there also symptoms of the plague were
already showing themselves; and each member would have preferred to be
at home with his family. And when Buckingham came before them at Oxford
with his proposal for a further grant, the ill-humour of the assembly
openly broke out. He was reproached with the illegality of his conduct
in asking for a grant of subsidies more than once in a session; the
members said that if this was the object of their meeting they might
well have been at home.<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a>
But they were not content with rejecting
the proposal: they said that if they must remain together, they would,
according to former precedent, bring under debate the prevailing abuses
and their removal.</p>

<p>Buckingham had been warned that by now changing his demeanour he would
run the risk of forfeiting those sympathies of Parliament, which he had
won by his Protestant attitude. In the very first session at Oxford an
event took place which set religious passions in agitation.</p>

<p>Before the departure of the Parliament from London Lord Keeper Williams
had promised in the King's name that the laws against Catholic priests
should be observed. Immediately after the Speaker had taken his seat at
Oxford, a complaint was made that an order for the pardon of six priests
had been since issued. Williams had had no share in it; he had refused
to seal it. It had been necessary to complete it in the presence of the
King, who was induced at the urgent request of Buckingham to give his
assent in pursuance of the conditions of the agreement executed with
France. This conduct however, the failure to execute laws that had been
ratified, especially after a renewed promise to the contrary, appeared
to the Parliament an attack upon its rights and upon the constitution of
the country. The ill-feeling was directed against Buckingham, whose
exceptional position was now the general object of public and private
hatred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[Pg 547]</a></span>
This was a time in which the power of a first minister in France, who
came forward as the representative of the monarchy, was winning its way
amid the strife of factions, and above all in opposition to the claims
of aristocratic independence. What Concini and Luynes had begun,
Richelieu with a strong arm carried systematically into effect.
Something similar seemed to be at hand in England also. It had been the
fashion of James I to give effect to his will in the state by means of a
minister, to whom he confided the most important affairs, and whom he
wished to be dependent solely on the King himself; and Charles I, in
this as in other matters, followed his father's example. Buckingham
became more powerful under him than ever. At the meetings of the Privy
Council the King hardly allowed any one else to speak: without taking
the votes of the members he accepted Buckingham's opinion as conclusive.
And yet it was apparent at the same time that this opinion did not
deserve preference from any worth of its own. The public administration,
so far as it was influenced by him, and his special department, the
Admiralty, furnished much occasion for just censure; and the general
policy on which he embarked appeared questionable and dangerous. He was
coarsely compared to a mule which took its rider into a wrong road.
Oxford suggested to men's minds the recollection of the opposition which
the great nobles had once offered to Henry III. People said that they
might perhaps have been to blame in form, but not in substance. It was
wished that Charles I might also govern the state by the help of his
wise and dignified councillors, and not with the aid of a single young
man. Parliament, the great men of the country, and those who filled the
highest offices, were almost unanimous against Buckingham. The Lord
Keeper Williams told the King openly at a meeting of the Privy Council
at Oxford, that nothing would quiet the apprehensions of his Parliament
but an assurance 'that in actions of importance and in the disposition
of what sums of money the people should bestow upon him, he would take
the advice of a settled and constant
council.'<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a>
The misconduct of the favourite in not applying the money
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[Pg 548]</a></span>
granted to the objects for which it was voted, was exactly the ground of the complaint urged
against him. Not only the real importance of the points in dispute, but
also the intention of driving Buckingham from his position, led
Parliament to reject all his proposals.</p>

<p>The King's adherence to his resolution of supporting his minister
greatly affected the state of affairs in England, which even at that
time presupposed and required an agreement between the Crown and the
Parliament.</p>

<p>Buckingham attributed the rejection of his proposals in Parliament to
personal enmity; and this he thought he could certainly overcome.
Williams, who in the time of James I had been entirely in the confidence
of the King, was after a time dismissed, not without harshness, and was
replaced by Thomas Coventry. The post of Lord Keeper was again filled by
a lawyer who troubled himself less about political affairs. Parliament
was not prorogued, as the rest of the members of the Privy Council
wished: the King agreed with Buckingham that it must be dissolved. The
Duke hoped that new elections, held under his influence, would give
better results. He did not doubt that another Parliament might be
hurried away to make extensive grants under the pressure of the great
interest opposed to Spain. But in order to effect this object it
appeared to him necessary to exclude from the Lower House its most
active members, who were his personal antagonists. He adopted the odious
means of advancing them to offices which could not be held compatible
with a seat in Parliament. In this way Edward Coke, who revived and
found arguments for the constitutional claims of Parliament, was
nominated sheriff of Buckinghamshire, and Thomas Wentworth High Sheriff
of Yorkshire. Francis Seymour, Robert Phillips, and some others, had a
similar fate.<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a>
When the lists were submitted as usual the King
unexpectedly announced these nominations. Some peers, whose views
inspired no confidence, were not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[Pg 549]</a></span>
summoned to attend the sittings of the Upper House.</p>

<p>Perhaps too much weight has been attributed to the circumstance&mdash;but yet
it proves the discontent which was widely spreading&mdash;that at the
coronation of the King, which took place during these days, the
traditional question addressed from four sides of the tribune to the
surrounding multitude, asking whether they approved, was not answered
from one side at least with the joyful readiness usually
displayed.<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a></p>

<p>On February 6, 1626, the new Parliament was opened at Westminster. It
made no great objection to the exclusion of some of the former members,
as the means by which this had been effected could not be regarded as
exactly illegal. Among the members assembled an ambition was rather felt
to prove that their opinions and resolutions were not dependent on the
influence of some few men. For all Buckingham's efforts to prevent it,
on this occasion also those opinions were in the ascendant which he
wished to oppose. In the place of the members excluded others arose, and
at times they were the very men from whom he feared nothing. A great
impression was made when a personal friend of Buckingham, his
vice-admiral in Devonshire, John Eliot, came forward as his decided
political opponent. He first brought under discussion the mismanagement
of the money granted, which was laid to the charge of the First
Minister. With this was connected a transaction of great importance
which affected the general relation between the Parliament and the
Crown.</p>

<p>In the year 1624 a council of war, consisting of seven members, had been
nominated to manage the money then granted. They were now summoned to
account for it. Although this measure appeared an innovation, yet the
government could do nothing against it&mdash;it had even consented to it: but
Parliament at the same time submitted to the members the invidious
question, whether their advice for the attainment of the ends in view
had always been followed. King James had said on a former occasion, that
if Parliament granted him subsidies, he had to
<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1626.</span>
account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[Pg 550]</a></span>
to it for their disposal as little as to a merchant from whom he received money; for he
loved to lay as much emphasis upon his prerogative as possible. How
entirely opposed to the prerogative were the claims which Parliament now
advanced! It is clear that if the members of the council should make the
communications they were asked for, all freedom of action on the part of
the minister and of the King himself would be called in question.</p>

<p>The members of the new council for war were thrown into great
embarrassment. They answered that they must first consult the lawyers on
the subject, and the King conveyed to them his approval of this
declaration. He informed them that he had had the Act of Parliament laid
before him: that they were bound to submit to questions only about the
application of the money, but about nothing else: he even threatened
them with his displeasure if they should go beyond this. The president
of the council for war, George Carew, called his attention to the
probability that the grant of the subsidies which he demanded from
Parliament might be hindered by such an answer: it would be better, he
said, that the Council should be sent to the Tower,&mdash;for it would come
to this,&mdash;than that the good relations between the King and the
Parliament should be impaired, and the payment of the subsidies
hindered. Charles I said that it was not merely a question of money, and
that gold might be bought too dear. He thanked them for the regard which
they had shown to him; but he added that Parliament was aiming not at
them but at himself.<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a></p>

<p>The controversy about tonnage and poundage coincided with this quarrel.
The grant, as has been mentioned, had been obtained only for a short
period. Parliament was incensed, that after this had expired, the King
had the customs levied just as before. 'How,' it was said, 'did the King
wish to raise taxes that had never been voted? Was not this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[Pg 551]</a></span>
altogether contrary to the form of government of the country? Whoever had
counselled the King to this step, he was without doubt the sworn enemy
of King and country.'</p>

<p>Parliament declared to the King that if he insisted on those subsidies
which were absolutely necessary, it would support him as fully as ever a
prince had been supported by a Parliament, but in Parliamentary fashion,
or, as they expressed it, 'via
parlamentaria.'<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a>
The claims of Parliament included both the right of granting money in its widest
extent, and the supervision of its application when granted. The King
considered that a grant was not necessary in respect of every source of
revenue&mdash;for instance, not in respect to tonnage and poundage, and was
determined to keep the management entirely in his own hands, and to
submit to no kind of control over it.</p>

<p>Many other questions, in which wide interests were involved, were
brought forward for discussion in Parliament, especially in regard to
ecclesiastical matters: the proceedings of the High Commission were
attacked again. But the question of the widest range of all was the
decided attempt to alter the government and to overthrow the great
minister, which gave perhaps the greatest employment to the
assembly.<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a>
It was directed against the favourite personally, for he
had now incurred universal hatred, but at bottom there also lay the
definite intention of confirming the doctrine of ministerial
responsibility by a new and signal example.</p>

<p>How quickly was Buckingham overtaken by Nemesis; that is to say, in
this, as in so many other instances, how soon was he visited by the
consequences which in the nature of things attended his actions! First,
owing to his influence the establishment of that council for war had
been granted which now gave occasion to the demand for Parliamentary
control: and next, he had allowed the fall of Bacon, and had most
deliberately overthrown Cranfield by the help of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[Pg 552]</a></span>
Parliament. These were just the transactions which endangered his own existence by the
consequences of the principles involved in both cases alike.</p>

<p>The King was certainly moved by personal inclination to take the part of
his minister; but he was also moved by anxiety about the application of
these principles. He complained that without actually established facts
forthcoming, on the strength of general rumour, people wished to attack
the man on whom he bestowed his confidence: but Parliament, he said, was
altogether overstepping its competence. It was wishing to inspect the
books of the royal officers, to pass judgment upon the letters of his
secretary of state, nay, even upon his own: it permitted and sheltered
seditious speeches within its bosom. There never had been a king, he
affirmed, who was more inclined to remove real abuses, and to observe a
truly Parliamentary course; but also there had never been one who was
more jealous of his royal honour. The more violently Buckingham was
attacked, the more it appeared to the King a point of honour to take him
under his protection against charges which he considered futile.</p>

<p>The Lower House did not take up all the points in dispute which the King
proposed for discussion. It excused some things which had occurred to
the prejudice of the royal dignity, but in the principal matter it was
immovable. It asserted, and adhered to its assertion, that it was the
constant undoubted right of Parliament, exercised as well under the most
glorious of former reigns as under the last, to hold all persons
accountable, however high their rank, who should abuse the power
transferred to them by their sovereign and oppress the commonwealth.
They maintained that without this liberty no one would ever venture to
say a word against influential men, and that the common-weal would be
forced to languish under their violence.</p>

<p>The impeachment was drawn up in regular form by eight members, among
whom we find the names of Selden, Glanvil, Pym, and Eliot. On the 8th of
May it was carried by 225 votes to 116 to send up to the Lords a
proposal for the arrest of Buckingham.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[Pg 553]</a></span>
In the Upper House, the members of which were by no means more
favourable to the Duke, and feared the nomination of a large number of
peers, Lord Bristol independently brought an accusation against
Buckingham relating to the failure of the Spanish marriage. The conduct
of which he is accused may rather have shown ambition and foolish
assumption than any real criminality; and Buckingham's defence is not
without force. The Lower House, to whom it was communicated,
nevertheless expressed their opinion that a formal prosecution must take
place. It seemed that Buckingham must surely but sink under the combined
weight of various complaints.</p>

<p>But the King would not allow matters to go so far. Without paying any
regard to the wish of the Lords to the contrary, he proceeded to
dissolve this Parliament also (June 15, 1626). In the declaration which
he issued on the subject, he said that he recognised Joab's hand in
these estrangements: but in spite of them he would fulfil his duty as
king of this great nation, and would himself redress their grievances
and defend them with the sword against foreign enemies.</p>

<p>The opposition between Parliament and the Crown did not develop by slow
degrees. In its main principles at least it appears immediately after
the accession of Charles I as a historical necessity. </p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p class='centersm'><a name="BV_VII" id="BV_VII"></a>
THE COURSE OF FOREIGN POLICY FROM 1625 TO 1627.</p>

<p>In reviewing so important a conflict as that which had broken out at
home, it almost requires an effort of will to bestow deep interest upon
foreign affairs in turn. But not only is this necessary from the
connexion between the two, but we should not be able to understand the
history of England if we left out of consideration its relation to those
great events of European importance which absorbed even the largest
share of public attention.</p>

<p>Charles I had undertaken to do what his father avoided to the end of his
life,&mdash;to offer open opposition to the Spanish monarchy and its aims.
Like Queen Elizabeth he took this step in alliance with France, Holland,
and the Protestants of Germany and the North, but yet not in full
agreement with his own people. This was due mainly to the circumstance
that France had become far more Catholic under Mary de' Medici and Louis
XIII than it had been under Henry IV. The offensive alliance between
France and England now developed a character which rather irritated than
quieted the religious feelings which prevailed in England.</p>

<p>On the first shocks sustained by the close alliance which had existed
between the Catholic powers, the Huguenots in France rose in order to
recover their former rights which had been curtailed. But the French
government was not at all inclined to give fresh life to these powerful
and dangerous movements: on the contrary it invoked the assistance of
England and Holland to put them down. For the great strength of the
Huguenots lay in their naval resources, and without the help of the
maritime powers the French government
<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1625.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[Pg 555]</a></span>
would never have been able to
overcome them. And so imperative seemed the necessity of internal peace
in France,<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a>
if she was to be induced to take an active share in the
war against Spain, that the English and Dutch were actually persuaded to
put their crews and vessels at the disposal of the French government,
which then used them with decisive results. The naval power of the
Huguenots, which had formed so large an element of the fighting strength
of the Protestants, was broken by the assistance of England and Holland.
Queen Elizabeth, in the midst of her war with Philip II, would certainly
never have been brought to this step, and even now it roused the
bitterest dislike. It was found that the execution of the orders issued
met with resistance even on board the ships themselves. A light is
thrown upon the ill-feeling at home, when a member of the Privy Council,
Lord Pembroke, tells a captain who resisted this mutinous spirit, that
the news of the insubordination of his crew was the best which he had
heard for a long time, and that it was welcome even to the King: that he
must deal leniently with his men, and only see that he remained master
of the ship.<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a>
But what an impression must doubtless have been
produced on the population of England, which still stood in the closest
relation to the French Reformed! Sermons were delivered from the pulpits
against these proceedings of the government.</p>

<p>But if the active alliance of France against Spain and Austria was
secured by this immense sacrifice, what could have appeared more natural
than to employ the whole strength of that country for the restoration of
the Count Palatine, which the French saw to be advantageous to
themselves, and for the support of German Protestantism? In pursuance of
the stipulations which had been made the King of Denmark was already in
the field: his troops had already fought hand to hand at Nienburg in the
circle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[Pg 556]</a></span>
Lower Saxony with the forces of the League which were
pressing forward into that country. He was strong in cavalry but weak in
infantry: the German envoys who were present in England insisted that
gallant English troops should be sent to his assistance, and that the
fleet which was ready for service should be ordered to the Weser; for
that the support which the fleet would give to the King would encourage
him to advance with good heart. And then, as they added with extravagant
hopefulness, the King of Sweden, who had already offered his aid, would
come forward actively, if only he had some security; the Elector of
Brandenburg, who had just married his sister to the King of Sweden,
would declare himself; the Prince of Transylvania, who was connected
with the same family, would force his way into Bohemia: every one would
withstand the League and compel it to restore the lands occupied by it
to their former sovereigns, and to the religion hitherto professed in
them.</p>

<p>But Buckingham had as little sympathy with the German as with the French
Protestants: his passionate ambition was to make the Spaniards directly
feel the weight of his hatred. For this purpose he had just concluded an
offensive and defensive alliance with the United Provinces; even the
great maritime interests of England were themselves a reason for
opposing Spain. At all events, in the autumn of 1625 he despatched the
fleet, not to the Weser, which appeared to him almost unworthy of this
great expedition, but against the coasts of the Spanish peninsula.
Orders were given to it to enter the mouth of the Guadalquivir, and to
alarm Seville, or else to take the town of Cadiz, for which object it
had on board a considerable number of land troops; or, finally, to lie
in wait for the Spanish fleet laden with silver, and to bring home the
cargo as a lawful prize. Buckingham proceeded on the supposition that
the foundation of the Spanish power and its influence would be
undermined by the interruption of the Spanish trade with America, and
that in the next year the Spaniards would be able to effect nothing. He
did not perceive that this would have no decisive influence on that
undertaking on which in<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1626.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[Pg 557]</a></span>
the first instance everything depended, that of
the King of Denmark, as meanwhile in Rome, Vienna, and Munich, native
forces, independent of Spain, had been collected. But while he preferred
the more distant to the more immediate end, it was his fate to achieve
neither the one nor the other. In December 1625 the fleet returned
without having effected anything at sea or on the Spanish coasts. On the
contrary it had suffered the heaviest losses itself.</p>

<p>The discredit into which Buckingham fell with those whom he had desired
to win over, and whose wishes were fixed on the struggle with Spain, is
exhibited in a very extraordinary enterprise which sprung up at this
time, and which had for its object the formation of what we may almost
call a joint-stock war company. A wish was felt to form a company for
making war on Spain, upon the basis, it is true, of a royal charter, but
under the authority of Parliament, with the intention of sharing the
booty and the conquests, as well as the costs among the
members.<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a></p>

<p>By the late enterprise moreover the means had been wasted which might
have been used for supporting the German allies of England. Left without
sufficient subsidies in his quarrel with Parliament, the King was unable
to pay the arrears due both to the seamen who were returning from Spain,
and to his troops in Holland. He could not repair his fleet; he could
hardly defend his coasts: how could he be in a position to make any
persevering effort for the conduct of the war in Germany? The King of
Sweden asked for only £15,000 in order to set his forces in motion; but
at that time this sum could not be raised. The King of Denmark was the
more thrown on England, as the French also made their services depend on
what the English would do: but Conway, the Secretary of State, declared
himself unable to pay the stipulated sum. Could men feel astonished that
the Danish war was not carried on with the energy which the cause seemed
to demand?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[Pg 558]</a></span>
Christian IV had not troops enough, and could not pay even
those which he had. The cavalry, which constituted his main strength,
had on one occasion refused to fight, because they had not received
their pay. He himself threw the chief blame on the English for the
defeat which he now sustained at Lutter; and which was the more
decisive, as meanwhile Mansfeld also, who wished to turn his steps to
the hereditary dominions of Austria in order to combine with the Prince
of Transylvania, had been not only defeated, but almost annihilated. The
armies which were to have defended the Protestant cause disappeared from
off the field. The forces of the Emperor and of the League now occupied
North Germany also on both sides of the Elbe.</p>

<p>To Germany the alliance with England had at that time brought no good.
It may be doubted whether the Elector Palatine would have accepted the
crown of Bohemia but for the support which he thought to find in
England. This affair had a great part in bringing on the outbreak of the
great religious conflict. But James I sought to retrieve the misfortune
into which the Elector had fallen, not so much by employing his own
power, as by developing his relations with the Spaniards; and thus he
had himself given them the opportunity of establishing themselves in the
Palatinate, and had caused the Catholic reaction to triumph in Upper
Germany. Without the instigation of England, and the great combination
of the powers in East and West hostile to the house of Austria, the King
of Denmark would not have determined to begin war, nor would the circle
of Lower Saxony have aided him. On this occasion as on others in England
the interests of its own power outweighed consideration for the allies.
The policy of the English had formerly been ruled by their friendly
relations with Spain: it was now ruled by their hostile intentions
towards that country. All available forces were employed for their
purpose, and the movement in Germany was left to its fate.</p>

<p>Meanwhile another consequence of the breach with Spain came to light,
which King James had always feared. In order not to be forced to fight
both great powers at once, Spain found it advisable to show a compliance
hitherto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[Pg 559]</a></span>
unprecedented in the affairs of Italy, in which France had
interested herself. After this the irritation against the ascendancy of
the Spaniards evidently abated in France.</p>

<p>For in alliances of great powers it is self-evident that their political
points of view, if for a moment they coincide, must nevertheless in a
short time be again opposed to one another. How should one power really
seek the permanent advantage of another?</p>

<p>At that time also, as on so many occasions, other relations arising out
of the position of the leading statesmen as members of parties, produced
an effect on politics. Cardinal Richelieu met with opposition from a
zealously Catholic party, which gathered round the queen mother, and
considered the influence of Spain to a certain degree necessary. This
party seized the first favourable opportunity of setting on foot a
preliminary treaty of peace, to which Richelieu, however long he
hesitated, and however much he disliked it, could not help acceding.</p>

<p>Quite in keeping with this understanding between the Catholic powers was
the partial recoil of Protestantism in England from the advances which
it had made to the Catholic party. The French who surrounded the Queen
were so numerous, that a strong feeling of opposition on religious and
national grounds was awakened in them by their contact with the English
character. They saw in the English nothing but heretics and apostates;
the Catholics who had formerly been executed at Tyburn as rebels they
honoured as martyrs. The Queen herself, upon whom her priests laid all
kinds of penance corresponding to her dignity, was once induced to take
part in a procession to this place of execution. It is conceivable how
deeply wounded and irritated the English must have felt at these odious
demonstrations. To the King it seemed insufferable that the household of
his consort should take up a position of open hostility to the
ecclesiastical laws of the land. Personally also he felt injured and
affronted. We hear complaints from him that he was robbed of his sleep
at night by these demonstrations. He quickly and properly resolved to
rid himself once for all of these refractory people, whatever might be
the consequence. The Queen's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[Pg 560]</a></span>
court was then refusing to admit into it
the English ladies whom he had appointed to attend on her. The King
seized the opportunity: he invited his wife to dine with him, for they
still had separate households; and after dinner he made her understand
by degrees that he could no longer put up with this exhibition of
feeling on the part of her retinue, but must send them all home again,
priests and laymen, men and women
alike.<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a>
This resolution was
carried out in spite of all the resistance offered by those whom it
affected. Only some few ladies and two priests of moderate views were
left with the Queen; all the rest were shipped off to France. There they
filled the court and the country with their complaints. Those about the
Queen-mother assumed an air as if the most sacred agreements had been
infringed, and any measure of retaliation was thought justifiable.</p>

<p>Marshal Bassompierre indeed set out once more for England in order to
bring about a reconciliation. Though ill received at first, he
nevertheless won his way by his splendid appearance and by clever talk
and moderation. In a preliminary agreement leave was given to the Queen
to receive back a number of priests and some French
ladies;<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a>
and Buckingham prepared to go to France to remove the obstacles still
remaining. But meanwhile the feeling of estrangement at the French court
had become still stronger. The agreement was not approved: and the court
would not hear of a visit from Buckingham, as it was thought that he
would be sure to use the opportunity afforded by his presence to stir up
the Huguenots. Richelieu thought that the dispute with England had been
provoked by his enemies in order to break up the friendly relations
which he had established. But nevertheless he too did not wish to see
Buckingham in France, for he feared that the English minister might side
outright with his opponents.</p>

<p>Personal considerations of many kinds co-operated in producing this
result, but it was not due mainly to their influence. The religious
sympathies and hatreds at work had incalculable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[Pg 561]</a></span>
effects. While the opposition between the two religions again awoke in all its strength,
and a struggle for life and death was being fought out between them in
Germany, an alliance could not well be maintained between two courts
which professed opposite religious views. The current of the general
tendencies of affairs has a power by which the best considered political
combinations are swept into the background.</p>

<p>The paramount importance of religious movements not only prevented a
combination between France and England, but also brought both Catholic
powers into closer agreement with one another, as soon as their
immediate differences had been in some measure adjusted. Father Berulle
had promoted the marriage of a French princess with the King of England
in the hope of converting him; but now that he became conscious of his
mistake, he lent his pen to a project for a common attack to be made by
the Catholic powers upon England. The domestic dissensions in that
country, which again aroused Catholic sympathies among a part of the
population, appeared to favour such a project. An agreement on the
subject was in treaty for some time. It was at last concluded and
ratified in France in the form in which it was sent back from
Spain.<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a></p>

<p>Although it is not clear that people in England had authentic
information of these negotiations, yet the advances made by the two
courts to one another, which were visible to every one, could not but
cause some anxiety in the third. The English were always anxiously
considering what Philip IV might have in view for the next year; at
times even in Charles' reign they feared another attack from the Belgian
coast. What would happen if France lent her aid in such an enterprise?
It was known at all events that the priests exhorted her to do so. That
France and Spain should make a joint attack on England appeared to be
most for the interest of the Catholic
world.<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[Pg 562]</a></span>
Another ground for anxiety in England was from that resolution to
revive the French naval power, which Richelieu had already taken in
consequence of his late experiences. He bought ships of war, or had them
built, and took foreign sailors into his service. Charles I perceived
this with the greatest displeasure. He regarded it as a threat against
England, for he thought that the French could have no other intention
than that of robbing England of the supremacy that she had exercised
from time immemorial over the sea which bears her name. He declared that
he was resolved to prevent matters from going so far.</p>

<p>A great effect was produced by a very definite misunderstanding which
now arose between England and France, and affected naval interests as
well as the question of religion.</p>

<p>Of all the French Huguenots, who had been compelled by their last defeat
to seek peace with the King, the citizens of Rochelle felt the blow most
deeply. They had at that time been hemmed in on all sides, and were
especially harassed by a fort erected in their neighbourhood. They had
been assured that at the proper time they would be relieved of this
annoyance. They had not an express and unequivocal promise; but the
English ambassador, who had been invited to mediate, had guaranteed to
them, after conference with the French ministry, such an interpretation
of the expressions used as would secure the wished-for
result.<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a>
But just the contrary took place: they were constantly being more closely
shut in, and more seriously threatened with the loss of that measure of
independence which they had hitherto enjoyed. They turned to Charles I.
They would rather have acknowledged him as their sovereign than have
submitted to such a loss, and he felt the full weight of his obligation
to them. But, if he desired to grant them assistance, it could only be
rendered by open war.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">A.D. 1627.</span>
When the English resolved to undertake an expedition against the Island
of Rhé, the prevention of the fall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[Pg 563]</a></span>
of Rochelle was not the only object
in view. It was rather considered that nothing could be more desirable
and advantageous than the command of this island in the event of a
struggle with the two powers. For Biscay could be reached in a voyage of
one night from thence, and the communication between the Netherlands and
the harbours on the north-east coast of Spain could at any time be
interrupted by the possessors of the island, which might be used at the
same time for keeping up constant communication with the Huguenots, and
for giving the French power employment at
home.<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a>
The Huguenots had already taken up arms again, and Rochelle displayed the English banner
on its walls. Charles I intended to use Rhé as a station for his fleet,
but to cede the general sovereignty over it to Rochelle. A successful
result here might serve to infuse new life into the Protestant cause.</p>

<p>In order to achieve so great an end the King thought it admissible to
levy a forced loan, and thus to collect those sums which Parliament had
promised him by word of mouth, but had not yet formally granted. We
shall have hereafter to consider the resistance which he encountered in
this attempt, and the various arbitrary acts to which he resorted for
its suppression; for they formed one of the turning points of his
history. At first he actually succeeded so far, that a fleet of more
than a hundred sail was able to put to sea for the attack of Rhé and the
support of Rochelle. It was considered in raising this loan that a war
with France had greater claims upon popular support than any other. In
the present doubtful state of affairs a decided advantage gained in such
a war might even now have exercised great influence upon the internal
state of the kingdom.</p>

<p>At this juncture Buckingham assumed a position of extraordinary
importance. After the repeated failures of the Protestants, his
undertaking aroused all their hopes. Directed against both the Catholic
powers, it must, if successful,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[Pg 564]</a></span>
have directly benefited the French
Protestants, and indirectly the German Protestants also by the effect
which it would inevitably have produced. But it was besides one
enterprise more undertaken by the sole power of the monarch: it was
carried out independently of any Parliamentary grants properly so
called. It represented the principle of a moderate monarchical
Protestantism, combined with toleration for the native Catholics, among
whom Buckingham endeavoured to find support. His was a position of which
the occupant must either be a great man or perish. Buckingham, who had
no equal in restless activity, and was by nature not devoid of
adroitness and ability, nevertheless had not that persevering and
comprehensive energy which is required for the performance of great
actions. He had not gone through the school of those experiences in
which minds ripen: and for the want of this training his native gifts
were not sufficient to compensate. He was so far fortunate as to gain
possession of the Island of Rhé; but Fort Martin, which had been erected
there a short time before, and on which the possession of the island
depended, defied his attacks, and he was not skilful enough to intercept
the support which was thrown into the fort in the hour of its greatest
danger. The defence of the French certainly showed greater perseverance
than the attack of the English. Buckingham did not know how to awaken
among his men that fiery devotion which shrinks from no obstacle, and
which would have been necessary here. And the measures which were
arranged at home were not so effective as to bring him at the right
moment the reinforcement he needed. In November 1627 he returned to
England without having effected his object. He left behind him the
French Protestants, and Rochelle especially, in the greatest distress.</p>

<p>Charles I had no intention of proving false to the promises which he had
given them, any more than he wished to allow the King of Denmark to sink
under his difficulties. But what means did he possess of bestowing help
either on the former or on the latter?</p>

<p>After the battle of Lutter he had told the Danish ambassador, that he
would come to the assistance of his uncle, even if he should have to
pawn his crown. How heavily his position
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[Pg 565]</a></span>
weighed on him at that time!
While he had undertaken the responsibility of contending for the
greatest interests of the world, he was obliged to confess, and did so
with tears in his eyes, that at present he hardly had at his disposal
the means of defraying the necessary expenses of his daily life.</p>

<p>The King of Denmark advised him to call Parliament together again, and
make the needful concessions, in order to obtain such subsidies as would
enable him to give vigorous support to his allies. Charles I in the
first instance took umbrage at this, because it was good advice from an
uncle and an elder, as if some blame were thereby cast on him: by
degrees he became convinced of the necessity of this measure.</p>

<p>It was quite evident from the events of the last few years that the King
would not be able to maintain the position he had assumed, without
active support from Parliament. </p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p class='centersm'><a name="BV_VIII" id="BV_VIII"></a>
PARLIAMENT OF 1628. PETITION OF RIGHT.</p>

<p>In the heat of controversy about the supplies to be granted and the
liberties to be confirmed by the King in return, it was once harshly
said in the Lower House during this Parliament that it was better to be
brought low by foreign enemies than to be obliged to suffer oppression
at home. The King answered by saying no less abruptly that it was more
honourable for the King to be straitened by the enemies of his country,
than to be set at nought by his own subjects.</p>

<p>So much more importance was attached by both sides to domestic than to
foreign struggles. But after the last failure both parties had come to
feel how much the honour of the country and religion itself suffered
from their dissensions. Among the politicians of the time there was a
school of learned men, who had studied the old constitution of the
country, and wished for nothing more than its restoration. They were
seriously bent on establishing an equilibrium between the royal
prerogative and the rights of Parliament. Among them were found Edward
Coke, John Selden, and John Glanvil; but Robert Cotton may be regarded
as the most distinguished of them all, a man who had studied most
deeply, and who combined with his studies an insight into the present
that was unclouded by passion. To Cotton we owe a report presented by
him to the Privy Council, in which he explains that the government
should proceed on the old royal road of collecting taxes by grant of
Parliament, and indeed should adopt no other method; while at the same
time he expresses the conviction that Parliament would be satisfied, if
its most pressing anxieties were dissipated. He says that he himself
would not advise the King to sacrifice the First Minister, for that such
<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1628.</span>
a step had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[Pg 567]</a></span>
always had ruinous consequences: he thought moreover that
the old passionate hostility against the Duke need not be feared, if he
came forward himself as the man who had advised the King to reassemble
Parliament.<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a>
We learn that the King did not determine to summon it,
until the most prominent men had given him an assurance that Buckingham
should not be attacked. Moderation in the attitude of Parliament, and
security for the First Minister formed as it were the condition under
which the Parliament of 1628 was
summoned.<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a></p>

<p>On March 22, five days after the beginning of the session, the
deliberations of the Lower House were opened by the remark from the
Speaker, that they must indeed grant subsidies to the King; but that at
the same time they must maintain the undoubted rights of the country.
Francis Seymour, who had now again been returned to Parliament, at once
expressed himself to the same effect. While he acknowledged that every
one must make sacrifices for king and country, he shewed at the same
time that it was a sacred duty to cling to their ancestral laws. He
proceeded to say that these laws had been transgressed, their liberties
infringed, their own selves personally ill-treated, and their property,
with which they might have supported the King, exhausted. He proposed
therefore to secure the rights, laws, and liberties transmitted from
their ancestors by means of a petition to the
King.<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a></p>

<p>Whatever be the tone of opposition which this language betrays, it fell
far short of that adopted in the former Parliament. Men had come to an
opinion that certainly no money should be granted unless securities
could be obtained for their ancient liberties; but at the same time that
the King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[Pg 568]</a></span>
should not be induced to grasp directly at absolute power, for
that this would lead at once to a rebellion of uncertain
issue.<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a>
Men were resolved to avoid questions which could rouse old passions. This
time it was not insisted that the penal laws against the Catholics
should be made more severe: Parliament waived its claim to alter the
constitution of the Admiralty, and to appoint treasurers to manage the
money granted to the King: it showed deference for the King, and said
nothing of the Duke. But a commission was appointed to take into
consideration the rights which subjects ought to have over their persons
and property. Already on April 3 resolutions were proposed to the House,
by which it was intended that some of the most obnoxious grievances
which had lately arisen should be made for ever impossible, such as the
collection of taxes that had not been granted, and restraints imposed on
personal liberty in consequence of refusal to
pay.<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a></p>

<p>Charles I also now took up this question. Through Coke his Secretary of
State, who was also a member of the House, he issued an invitation to
them not to allow themselves to be deterred by any anxiety about liberty
or property from making those grants, on which, as he said, the welfare
of Christendom depended; 'upon assurance,' Coke proceeds to add, 'that
we shall enjoy our rights and liberties, with as much freedom and
security in his time as in any age heretofore under the best of our
kings; and whether you shall think fit to secure ourselves herein, by
way of bill or otherwise, so as it be provided for with due respect to
his honour and the publick good whereof he doubteth not that you will be
careful, he promiseth and assureth you that he will give way to it.'</p>

<p>This is indeed a very important message. The King approves of an inquiry
into the violations of old English right and prescription, which had
taken place in his reign. He consents that a bill to secure their
observance should be drawn up, and gives hopes beforehand of its
ratification.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[Pg 569]</a></span>
Charles I, like James, had constantly been anxious to
prevent grants from being made dependent on conditions; but something
very like this occurs when he backs his invitation to a speedy grant of
subsidies by a promise to approve of the petition submitted to him for
certain objects.</p>

<p>On this five subsidies were without delay unanimously granted to the
King, with the concurrence even of members like Pym, who systematically
opposed him. It was now only necessary that both sides should agree on
the enactments for doing away with the abuses which had been pointed
out.</p>

<p>The principal grievance arose from the conduct of the King, who in his
embarrassments had imposed a forced loan at the rate fixed on the
occasion of the last subsidies, and had sent commissioners into the
counties in order to exact payment, just as if he had been armed with
the authority of Parliament for this object. Many had submitted: but not
a few others high and low had refused to pay, not from want of means but
on principle. The King had thought this behaviour a proof of personal
disaffection, and had had no hesitation in arresting those who refused:
he had even taken steps to assert his right to do so as a matter of
principle. Much notice was attracted at that time by a sermon preached
by one Sibthorp, in which plenary legislative authority was ascribed to
the King, and unconditional obedience was demanded for all his orders if
they did not contradict the divine commands. Archbishop Abbot had
steadfastly refused to allow the printing of this sermon, which he
regarded as an attack upon the constitution: eighteen times in
succession an intimate friend of the King went to him to urge him to
give leave.<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a>
As the Archbishop refused to comply, he received orders
to leave London, and was struck out of the High Commission: the sermon
had been printed with the permission of another bishop. So earnestly
bent was the King at that time on pressing his claim to override the
necessity of a parliamentary grant in moments of emergency.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[Pg 570]</a></span>
He had now however retreated from this position. Abbot had obtained
permission to resume his seat in the Upper House, and so had Lord
Bristol. When, in consequence of the above-mentioned declaration in
Parliament, a project was now decided on for securing the legal position
of the subject, especially the rights of property and personal freedom,
which had been infringed by the previous proceedings, the King expressed
his agreement loudly, explicitly, and repeatedly; in general terms he
gave up his claim ever to proceed again to a forced loan. No one was
ever to be arrested again because he would not lend money; and in all
other cases where arrest was necessary the customary forms were to be
observed.</p>

<p>At this point however another question arose touching the very essence
of the supreme power. The Lower House was not yet content that an abuse
like that which had occurred should be merely removed: it wished to
destroy it at the root. It was not satisfied with the promise of the
King that he would never in any case punish by arrest, unless he was
convinced in his conscience of its necessity. They wished to put an end
to this discretionary power itself, of which his ministers could avail
themselves at pleasure. Parliament demanded that henceforth no one
should be arrested without assignment of the reason and observance of
the forms of law.</p>

<p>This question led to a discussion of points of constitutional doctrine
before the House of Lords, between the representatives of the Lower
House and Sir Robert Heath, the Attorney General, in an argument which
deserves our whole attention.</p>

<p>The Lower House appealed to that article of Magna Charta, by which the
arrest of free persons was forbidden except on the judgment of their
peers, or according to the law of the land: and by the law of the land
it understood the judicial process and its forms. Sir Robert Heath would
not admit this interpretation. He thought that the expression in no way
forbade the King to restrict the liberty of individuals in extraordinary
cases for reasons of state; and that this restriction could not be
avoided, when it was desired to trace out some conspiracy or treason. If
the cause were to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[Pg 571]</a></span>
be assigned he thought that it must be the real
cause, which could be proved before a tribunal; but how often cases
arose of such a kind that arrest would have to be ordered under some
other pretext, until the ring-leader could be laid hold of! It was very
true, he said, that such a power might be seriously abused, but it was
the same with all the rights of the prerogative: even the right of
making war and peace, and the right of pardon might be abused, and yet
no man wished to take these from the crown: it always was, and must
always be presumed, that the King would not betray the confidence of
God, who had placed him in his office.</p>

<p>Not without good reason did Edward Coke call this the greatest question
which had ever been argued in Westminster. It was proved to him that he
himself as judge had followed the interpretation which he now condemned.
He answered that he was not pope, and made no pretensions to
infallibility. He now firmly maintained that the King had no such
prerogative at all.</p>

<p>We can see how opinion wavered from a speech of Sir Benjamin Rudyard,
who maintains on the one hand that it is impossible to find laws
beforehand for every case, but that a circle must be drawn within which
the royal authority shall prevail; while on the other hand he lays
emphasis also on the danger arising from the plea of mere reasons of
state, which he said would only too easily come into conflict with the
laws and with religion itself. The best arrangement according to him
would be, if Parliament were held so often that the irregular power
which could not be broken at once, might by degrees 'moulder away.' A
copy of this speech with observations by Laud is extant in the archives.
Laud calls attention to the contradiction which lies in first
acknowledging the necessity of liberty of movement on the part of the
government, and then notwithstanding considering it to be the
destination of Parliament by degrees to absorb its power, as it was at
present exercised.<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[Pg 572]</a></span>
And certainly it may have been the idea of the moderate members of the
House of Commons, gradually to break up such a power as that exercised
by the minister and favourite, by coming to a better understanding with
the King, and at the same time by strictly limiting his arbitrary
authority.</p>

<p>The impression however gained ground that even the indispensable
functions of the supreme authority would be restricted by the enactments
proposed. The right of arresting persons dangerous and troublesome to
the government was just then exercised in France to the widest extent;
Cardinal Richelieu could never have maintained himself but for his quick
and energetic use of it. In all other states, as well republican as
monarchical, it was a weapon with which the government thought that it
could not dispense. Was it to be dropped in England alone? And that too
at a moment when the opposition of factions was constantly becoming more
active? In fact the impression spread that Parliament, not content with
full promises from the King, while it checked abuses, was impairing his
authority.</p>

<p>In the Upper House, where there was a strong party in favour of the
King's prerogative, these and similar considerations influenced votes.
Men were agreed that abuses like those which had occurred must be for
ever put a stop to. Even the proposals introduced for securing
individual freedom were not properly speaking rejected: but it was
desired to limit them by a clause to the effect that the sovereign power
with which the King was entrusted should remain in his hands
undiminished for the protection of his people. The Lower House however
would not accept any such addition: for the provisions of the Petition
would thus be rendered useless. They foresaw that what those provisions
forbade would pass as lawful in virtue of the plenitude of the sovereign
power: yet the expression 'sovereign power' was unknown in the English
Parliament: that body was familiar only with the prerogative of the
King, which at the same time was embodied in the laws. The Upper House
on this declared that it did not think of departing from the Oath by
which each one of them was pledged to maintain the prerogative of the
King. Even in the Lower House the members were reminded of this,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[Pg 573]</a></span>
and no one raised his voice against it; for who would have been willing to
confess that he was withstanding the lawful prerogative of the King? The
only question was as to its extent.</p>

<p>This question now presented itself to the King himself. Was he to accept
the proposal of the Commons, and to content himself with a general
reservation of his prerogative? It is very instructive, and forms one of
the most important steps in his career, that he thought it advisable to
inform himself first of all what rights in this matter he really
possessed.</p>

<p>On the 26th of May, just when the heat of the quarrel was most intense,
he summoned the two Chief Justices, Hyde and Richardson, to Whitehall,
and submitted to them the question whether or not he had the right of
ordering the arrest of his subjects without specifying the reason at the
same time. On this the Judges were assembled by their two chiefs in the
profoundest secrecy, to pronounce on the question. They decided that it
certainly was the rule to specify the reasons; but that there might be
cases in which the secrecy required made it necessary for some time to
withhold them. A further question was then followed by a decision of the
same import, that the judges in such a case were not bound to give up
the prisoner even if a writ of habeas corpus were presented. Charles
then proceeded to a third question, to which no doubt he attached the
most importance. If he accepted the petition of the Commons, did he
surrender for ever the right of ordering imprisonment without assigning
a cause? The judges assembled again, and on the 31st of May, after
deliberating together, they gave in their answer, signed with their
names. Every law, they said, had its own interpretation; and so must
this petition: and the answer must always depend upon the circumstances
of the case in question, which could not be determined until the case
arose; but the King certainly did not give up his right beforehand by
granting the petition.<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a></p>

<p>At a later time and in another epoch these questions were finally
settled in a different way. The Judges of this time decided them in
favour of the power of the time. If we might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[Pg 574]</a></span>
apply a parallel, though
certainly one borrowed from a very different form of government, we
might say that the fettah of men learned in the law, the sentence of the
mufti, was in favour of the King. In this, as in other respects, a
difference is found to exist between the constitutions of the East and
those of the West: such a sentence in the West does not finally decide a
case; but even here, nevertheless, it always carries great weight.
Charles I felt that according to the existing state of the law, he did
not exceed his rights by maintaining the prerogative which he had
hitherto exercised. The last decision raised him even above the
apprehension of losing it by acceding to a petition which was opposed to
it.</p>

<p>He could not however resolve on this step without further consideration.</p>

<p>To accede to the petition, and at the same time to reserve in his own
favour the declaration made by the Judges, was an act of duplicity,
which he wished to escape by giving an assurance couched in general
terms.</p>

<p>On the 2nd of June he came down to the House in full assembly, and had
his answer read. Its tenor was, that the laws should be observed and the
statutes put in force, and his subjects freed from oppression; that he
the King was as anxious for their true rights and liberties as for his
own prerogative.</p>

<p>But it is easily intelligible that these words satisfied no one. They
appeared to one party as dark as the sentence of an oracle; to the other
they appeared useless; for the King, they said, was already pledged to
all this by his Coronation Oath: such long sittings and so much labour
would not have been required to effect such a result as this. The answer
however was not ascribed to the King, whose deliberations remained
shrouded in the closest secrecy, and who on the contrary was thought to
agree with the substance of the petition, but to the favourite, who was
supposed to find such an agreement dangerous for
himself.<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a>
It was remarked that two days before making this declaration the King had been
at one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[Pg 575]</a></span>
the country seats of the Duke, and had held confidential
conversations with him. It was thought that there, under the influence
of the Duke, the declaration had been drawn up, which contained nothing
but words that might easily be explained in another sense, and which did
not even make any mention of the petition at all. It was fancied that
Buckingham even wished to hinder the King from coming to a genuine
understanding with his Parliament, which might be disadvantageous to his
interests.<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a>
His opponents thought that he was at the root of all
previous misfortunes; and what might they not still expect from him? He
was credited with wishing to alter the constitution of England, to
excite a war with Scotland, and to betray Ireland to the Spaniards. In
spite of all that the King might have originally expected, they
determined to make a direct attack upon such a minister. Popular
susceptibility knows no limits in its anxieties or hopes, in its likings
or hatreds. Even thoughtful and serious men allowed themselves to
entertain the opinion that the prosperity of England at home and abroad
was as good as lost: the former was lost if people were content with the
answer given, the latter if they refused to make the grants demanded, or
even if they made them but left the administration in those
untrustworthy hands in which it was at the present time. On one occasion
these feelings gave rise to an unparalleled scene in Parliament. Those
bearded and sedate men wept and cursed. They feared for their country,
and each one feared for himself, if they did not get rid of the man who
possessed power, while on the other hand it seemed to them impossible to
do so. Some could not speak for tears: violent exclamations against the
Duke prevented the continuance of the debate. But not only were
complaints heard: the expression was also heard, that men had still
hands and swords, and could get rid of the enemy of King and country by
his death. They proceeded at last to deliberate on a protestation which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[Pg 576]</a></span>
was resolved on after that debate, and they had gone so far as to name
the Duke, and to declare him a traitor, when the Speaker who had quitted
the House came in again, and brought a message from the King, by which
the sitting was adjourned to the following day.</p>

<p>No course seemed to be left for Charles I but to dissolve this
Parliament immediately as he had dissolved its predecessor. But what
would then have become of the grant of money, which was every day more
urgently needed? Like the Petition, it would have fallen to the ground.</p>

<p>Before the end of the same day, June 5, a meeting of the Privy Council
was held, in which it was resolved to calm the agitation by accepting
the Petition of Right. We do not learn if on that occasion the scruples
of the King were discussed or not; but as his questions to the judges
already betrayed his inclination to such a course, so now he actually
resolved to plunge into the contradiction which he had wished to avoid,
and accept the Petition while at the same time, in accordance with the
sentence of the Judges, he would reserve for himself the future exercise
of the right therein denied.</p>

<p>On June 7 the King appeared in the Upper House, where the Commons also
were assembled. The Lords were in their robes, and the King sat upon his
throne while the Petition of Right was read. It was directed against
some temporary grievances, such as forced billeting and the application
of martial law in time of peace, but principally against the exaction of
forced loans, or taxes which had not been granted, and against the
imprisonments which had been so much talked of. The King, as had been
desired, uttered the formula of assent used by his Norman ancestors. His
words were greeted with clapping of hands and acclamations. The King
added that he had meant just as much by his first declaration; indeed he
knew well that it was not the intention of Parliament, nor even in its
power, to limit his prerogative: for that this would be strengthened by
the liberties of the people, and consisted in defending those
liberties.<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">[Pg 577]</a></span>
The excitement of the House was taken up by the city. The bells were
rung, and bonfires were kindled; and a rumour obtained credence that the
Duke of Buckingham himself had fallen, and was expecting his reward on
the scaffold. Of what an illusion were men the victims! The King clung
to Buckingham as firmly as ever: in granting the Petition he did not
mean to surrender a jot of his lawful prerogative. We have seen what he
thought of his right to make arrests. In resigning his claim to levy
taxes that had not been granted by Parliament he did not mean to be
restricted in his claim to tonnage and poundage, for he thought that,
unless these were collected, the administration of the State could not
be carried on at all, and in the late controversies his right to them
had not come under discussion. Some of the higher officials, the
Recorder and the Solicitor General, confirmed the King in this view: and
to many of his opponents in Parliament it was pointed out that they had
previously entertained the same opinion.</p>

<p>The Lower House on its part allowed the bill, by which the grant was
made, to pass the last stage; but it could not be moved by advice or
warning to desist from the great Remonstrance, in the composition of
which the House had been interrupted. In this, mention was made of the
Arminian opinions which were now making way in England, and which
appeared to Parliament to involve a tendency in the direction of
Romanism: but it complained principally of the connivance, which in
spite of all ordinances was still constantly extended to the recusants,
so that Catholicism, especially in Ireland, had the fullest scope. And
the State, it was said, was in just the same plight as religion. The
government was introducing foreign soldiers, especially German troopers,
and was meditating the imposition of new taxes in order to pay them. In
the midst of peace a general was commanding in the country. Trustworthy
men were being dismissed from their offices; Parliament and its rights
were contemned: was it intended to 'change the frame both of religion
and government?'<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a>
But the source of all evil was the Duke of
Buckingham. The remonstrants begged the King to consider
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[Pg 578]</a></span>
whether it was advisable for himself and for his kingdom to allow him to continue in
his high offices, and to keep him among his confidential
advisers.<a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a></p>

<p>As we gather, the Lower House attached weight to the circumstance that
it did not raise a complaint, nor even strictly speaking a protest,
against the continuance of Buckingham's authority, but simply preferred
a request that the position of affairs should be taken into
consideration. But the King was greatly offended even at this. He
replied that he had hitherto always believed that the members of the
Lower House understood nothing about the affairs of State, and that he
was now greatly strengthened in his opinion by the purport of this
representation.<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a>
Buckingham prayed the King to cause unsparing
investigation into the charges raised against him to be made, for that
such a proceeding would bring his innocence to light. The King offered
him his hand to kiss, and addressed to him some friendly expressions.
But the Lower House was incensed afresh at the bad success of its
representation, and proceeded to adopt an express remonstrance on the
subject of tonnage and poundage. In order to save himself from again
receiving such an address, the King declared Parliament to be prorogued
on June 20.</p>

<p>Although it was assumed just at that time that a genuine understanding
between the Crown and the Parliament had been brought about in this
session, yet this assumption is certainly a mistake. At the beginning of
the session suspicious controversies were intentionally avoided. A basis
was obtained upon which union between the two parties seamed possible:
the great Petition of Right was drawn up, on the whole in concert with
the government. When it was discussed however, a demand was set up
affecting rights which the King would not forego. He surrendered them in
his eagerness to obtain the proceeds of the grants made to him, but not
without secretly reserving his rights in his own favour.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[Pg 579]</a></span>
Then other old differences also came to light again in their full strength. An open
disagreement broke out: in haste and with tempers irritated the two
parties separated. </p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<p class='centersm'><a name="BV_IX" id="BV_IX"></a>
ASSASSINATION OF BUCKINGHAM. SESSION OF 1629.</p>

<p>For some years nothing had surprised foreigners who came to England so
much as the wide severance between the government and the nation. Upon
the one side they saw the King, the favourite, and his adherents; upon
the other every one else. The King had lost much of the popularity which
he had enjoyed when he ascended the throne; but a genuine hatred was
directed against the arbitrary government of the Duke. Although it had
been repressed out of regard to the King, it had again broken loose: the
less practical result it produced, the more it filled all hearts.</p>

<p>Burdened with this hatred, and with the ground shaking under him,
Buckingham was nevertheless revolving the largest enterprises in his
brain. He repelled with scorn the charge of still keeping up an
intercourse with Spain; that was contrary to his obligations to the
Protestants. He himself, so he said, had concluded the alliances between
England and Denmark and the States-General; and he wished also to abide
by them. Without doubt overtures had been made on the part of Spain, and
had been responded to on the part of England; but their relations had in
fact been such as had led to no result. On the contrary, negotiations
with France, which certainly offered some prospect of success, had been
opened through the mediation of the Venetian ambassadors resident at the
two courts. The English were ready to waive all other points at issue if
the other side would resolve to show some indulgence, especially if they
would conclude some tolerable arrangement with Rochelle. The forces of
both powers would then undertake the war
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[Pg 581]</a></span>
against the Spanish monarchy, and against the advance of the Emperor in Germany. The French army would
turn its steps to Italy; the English fleet would go to the aid of the
Danes: it was expected that these attacks would exert an enormous
influence in all
directions.<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a>
Buckingham was still engrossed with
designs against Spain, in spite of secret but only pretended overtures
to that power. He intended to attack the Spanish monarchy at the source
of its greatness, in the West Indies; and by a combination of forces on
the Continent to wrest the Palatinate from it, and thereby to destroy
the position which it had won on the Middle Rhine. A strange ambition,
although in keeping with the age and with his personal character,
appears to have been connected with this design. It had entered into his
head to marry his daughter to the Electoral Prince Palatine, and perhaps
to give his daughter the appearance of a higher rank by getting himself
declared independent prince of some West Indian conquest&mdash;Jamaica had
attracted his ambition<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a>:&mdash;a
hope not altogether chimerical; for he
was still all-powerful with Charles. Foreigners were astonished that he
undertook the most extensive negotiations before he had given his
sovereign notice of them. Not unlike James I he cherished the hope that
the threatening attitude which he took up, even if he did not strike a
blow, would dispose the French to make concessions and would restore the
former understanding between them. If this were not the case, he was
determined to undertake the relief of Rochelle with all his energies.</p>

<p>The condition of the English navy was such that he might reasonably
promise himself success. We have credible information according to which
Buckingham had made it half as large again as it had been in the time of
Elizabeth. He had increased it from 14,000 tons burden to 22,000: he
had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[Pg 582]</a></span>
put the dockyards and magazines at Chatham, Deptford, Woolwich, and
Portsmouth into good repair; and a number of large vessels had been
built under his orders. Already in May an English squadron had made an
attempt to relieve Rochelle: but the commanders on that occasion would
not undertake the responsibility of exposing the ships entrusted to
them, to the great danger which threatened them if they made the
attempt: they were apprehensive of being called to account. Buckingham
was not fettered by considerations of this kind. He had had engines of
extraordinary dimensions constructed, which it was expected would rend
with irresistible power the mole in front of the harbour, by which
Rochelle was cut off.<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a>
And who shall say that success would have been impossible?</p>

<p>Buckingham felt the hatred which men entertained towards him, but
thought that he should still turn it into admiration. He wished to atone
for the faults of his youth, and, as he said, to enter on new paths
traced on the lines of the ancient maxims and ancient policy of England,
in order to bring back better
days.<a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a>
He had to a certain extent made himself the centre of Protestant interests. Every one expected that he
would proceed without delay to the relief of Rochelle, for which all
preparations had been made. The destinies of the world seemed to hang
upon his resolutions. And he had just received better tidings from that
town: no one had ever seen him fuller of strength and energy. At this
culminating point of his life he was smitten by a sudden and horrible
death. As he stepped out of the dressing-room in his lodging at
Portsmouth, and was crossing the hall, in order to mount his carriage
and drive to the King, he was murdered by a stroke from a dagger.</p>

<p>The murderer might easily have escaped, for the house was full of men,
among them many Frenchmen, on whom the first suspicion fell. While all
were crying out for the villain who had murdered the Duke, the murderer
said, 'No villain did it,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[Pg 583]</a></span>
but an honourable man. I am the man.' Men saw
before them a lean man with red hair, and dark melancholy features. His
name was Felton: he had served in the last maritime expeditions, and had
formerly been passed over when there was a vacancy for promotion. He
could not endure to be placed below men who had never borne arms, merely
because they were in the Duke's favour. The strongest impression had
been produced on him by the
Remonstrance,<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a>
which censured similar transactions, and at the same time represented the Duke as the enemy of
religion and his country. Felton was one of these men, who from the way
in which they combine religious and political opinions are capable of
anything. In this respect he may be compared with the assassins of
William of Orange, Henry III, and Henry IV; except that he came forward
in behalf of the opposite side, and in his case there is no mention of
any participation of a minister of religion. A paper was found on him in
which he pronounced that man cowardly and base who was not ready to
sacrifice his life for the cause of his God, his king, and his country.
In his lodging there was another, on which he had put down some
principles, which he seemed to have drawn from one or two books, and
which make his intentions somewhat clearer. It is there said that a man
has no relations which place him under greater obligations than those
which he has with his country; that the welfare of the people is the
highest law, and that 'God himself has enacted this law, that whatsoever
is for the profit or benefit of the commonwealth should be accounted to
be lawful.'<a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a>
He was believed, and rightly, when he affirmed that he
had no accomplices: the slight put upon him, he said, had inspired him
with the thought, the Remonstrance had strengthened him in it: 'On my
soul,' he repeated, 'nothing but the Remonstrance. He thought that he
might remove the man out of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">[Pg 584]</a></span>
the way who obstructed the public welfare. And he looked with some feeling of sarcasm at those who testified their
horror of him when he was led by: 'In your hearts,' he cried out, 'you
rejoice in my deed.' There were some in fact who really displayed such a
feeling: the crews, who had once already wished to mutiny, disguised
their sentiments least; over their beer and pipes they gave the assassin
a cheer. Others lamented most that an Englishman should have been
capable of assassination. Felton himself was afterwards convinced that
his principles were false. He was told that a man had other still nearer
and deeper obligations to God, and to his own soul, than to his country;
that no one should do the smallest evil for the sake of the greatest
good,<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a>
much less then a monstrous crime like his in behalf of a
cause which to his blinded eyes appeared good. He at last thanked his
instructors for their lesson, and only asked in mercy to be allowed
before his execution to do penance in sackcloth with ashes on his head,
and a cord round his neck, in presence of all the world.</p>

<p>In public King Charles never lost his calmness of demeanour for a
moment. He appeared to accept the event as a dispensation of Heaven; but
afterwards he shut himself up for two whole days, and gave way to his
sorrow.</p>

<p>The expedition against Rochelle now put to sea under the command of the
Earl of Lindsay. But the captains did not properly obey their chief:
orders which had been planned and issued remained unexecuted: the
fire-ships, which were intended to break through the defences of the
enemy, were ill-managed. The intention was then formed of waiting for a
higher tide, in order to attempt another attack; but meanwhile the very
last resources of the town were exhausted, and it found itself obliged
to capitulate. England's position in the world was immeasurably lowered
when Rochelle was conquered by Richelieu. What further schemes of
maritime supremacy had Buckingham latterly connected with the
maintenance of this town! The ideas of Buckingham vanished as completely
as if they had never been: the<span class="sidenote">A.D. 1629.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">[Pg 585]</a></span>
ideas of Richelieu became the foundation
of a new order in the world.</p>

<p>Krempe also fell, which had hitherto been deemed impregnable, the spot
which, with Gluckstadt, was still the principal stay of Danish
independence, and to which Buckingham's attention had been constantly
directed. It is thought that about 8000 men would have sufficed to
relieve it, but as they were not forthcoming, the fortress fell into the
hands of the enemy in November 1628.</p>

<p>And Charles I, instead of placing himself in a position to repair these
losses of his allies, embarked on a new domestic quarrel with the
Parliament.</p>

<p>As the customs had not been fixed by the advice of Parliament, and
tonnage and poundage had not been regularly granted at all, some London
merchants had refused to satisfy the Custom House. On this the Lords of
the Treasury laid their property under seizure. Of course the persons
affected declared this proceeding also illegal, and filled the country
with their complaints. On this occasion it was not, as almost always
hitherto, the want of an immediate subsidy, but the necessity of
removing this constitutional difficulty, which caused Parliament to be
assembled in January 1629. People might flatter themselves that after
the death of Buckingham, who had been the object of the principal
hostility of that body, an agreement would be more easily effected.</p>

<p>The plan drawn up by the Privy Council was in the first instance of a
conciliatory nature. The right of granting money in general was to be
acknowledged, even in the case of tonnage and poundage: the levying of
this tax up to the present time, however, was to be justified, on the
ground that other kings had collected it before it had been granted. If
Parliament, after this general acknowledgement of its right, should
still persist in refusing the present King what former kings had
enjoyed, he would be exculpated: not the government, but Parliament
would in that case have to bear the blame of the breach which would
arise in consequence.<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a></p>

<p>This was the tenor of the King's speech at the opening of the discussion
on January 23, 1629. He asked for tonnage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[Pg 586]</a></span>
and poundage, less on the strength of his hereditary right to it, than on the plea of custom and
necessity. He would always consider it as a gift of his people; but
after their scruples had been removed by this declaration, he expected
that an end would be put to all difficulties by a grant such as had been
made to his ancestors. It was offensive to him that any one contested
his title to a tax, without which his state could not be kept up. In the
assembled Privy Council he declared that a temporary grant was
derogatory to his honour. He said that he would no longer live from hand
to mouth: he had as little disposition to suffer from want, or to allow
the privileges of his crown to be wrested from him, as he had had
thought of infringing the liberties of his
people.<a name="FNanchor_491_491" id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a>
Secretary Coke, a member of the House, brought in the requisite bill without delay, and
proposed the first reading.</p>

<p>The assembly, however, consisted of the very men who had thought that
through the Petition of Right they had set up a fundamental law for
ever, but had since then become conscious how little they had effected
by that means.</p>

<p>An unpleasant impression had already been made on them by the printing
of the Petition of Right without the expression of simple approval, but
with the restrictive declarations which the King had at first
made.<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a>
But besides this it was seen how little the King intended to be bound to
the literal meaning of his words, for arrests without definite
assignment of the reason had again taken place. The Star Chamber, which
was already regarded as a court of doubtful legality, had imposed harsh
and arbitrary penalties which awakened loud murmurs. The political
opinions of one or two clergymen had caused general agitation. A
preacher named Roger Manwaring gave utterance to extreme Royalist views.
He defended forced loans, and contested the unconditional right of
Parliament to grant taxes. From some passages of Scripture he deduced
the absolute power of the sovereign, so that properly speaking no
contract at all could, in his opinion,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">[Pg 587]</a></span>
be made between king and
people.<a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a>
Parliament had called him to account for this, and had
punished him by fine and suspension; but the King remitted the sentence.
Another clergyman of kindred views, Montague, whom we have already
mentioned, had been advanced by the King to the bishopric of Chichester,
though, as deserves to be noticed, not without encountering opposition.
For at the elections the old forms were still observed. Before the
commissary of the Archbishop confirmed the election, which had taken
place at the King's commands, he invited those present, if they knew
anything in the life and conduct of the bishop-elect which could hinder
his confirmation, to declare it. What had never been done on any other
occasion was done then. An objection against Montague was presented in
writing on the ground that doctrines occurred in his books which were
irreconcilable with the existing institutions of England. The matter was
brought before a court of justice, which, however, dismissed the
objection as proceeding from a man who did not belong to the diocese of
Chichester. The royal confirmation had then
followed.<a name="FNanchor_494_494" id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a>
But must it not have been irritating to Parliament that the very men were promoted
about whom it had complained? Its complaints seemed rather to serve as a
recommendation.</p>

<p>Besides this a Jesuit institution had been discovered in the immediate
neighbourhood of London, and had then not been prosecuted with all the
severity which Parliament thought requisite. People complained that the
number of Papists was increasing every day; that in the counties, where
before there had been none, they were now reckoned by thousands. Mainly
at the instigation of Sir John Eliot, the Lower House issued a
declaration, that it desired to hold the Articles of the English Church
in the sense in which they were understood by the writers, whose
authority was recognised in that Church, and not in the sense of the
Jesuits and Arminians, which was repudiated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">[Pg 588]</a></span>
The question of tonnage and poundage came before the House while it was
labouring under the irritation kindled by this discussion. What the
government desired, the establishment of this tax on a legal footing,
was also the wish of Parliament; but Parliament wished the matter to be
settled in a way different from that intended by the King. Parliament
desired to make the right of granting taxes a genuine reality, and
henceforward to fix the duties in detail. The first reading of the bill
brought forward by the government was rejected, on the formal ground
that tonnage and poundage were subsidies, for granting which a
resolution must be taken before a bill on the subject could be brought
in.<a name="FNanchor_495_495" id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a>
Parliament espoused the cause of the London merchants, who had
certainly suffered in support of its claims, and demanded that the
proceedings of the Treasury should be reversed. For they maintained that
the collection of tonnage and poundage was as much a breach of the
fundamental principles of the realm, as the raising of any other tax
that had not been granted would be. Or could any one, they asked, grant
what he did not possess? If tonnage and poundage already belonged to the
King, he did not need to have it granted him. The arrangement proposed
by the government was rejected altogether: and everything else which was
inconsistent with the literal meaning of the petition was also declared
illegal.</p>

<p>The King was incensed at the political, as well as at the religious
attitude of the Lower House. A treatise in his own handwriting is
extant, in which he expresses himself on the latter subject. 'You take
to yourselfs,' he says, 'the interpretation of articles of religion, the
deciding of which in doctrinal points only appartaines to the clergy and
convocation.'<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a>
He added that His Majesty&mdash;for he loved to speak of
himself in the third person&mdash;had a short time before announced his
intention of maintaining the integrity of the religion of the English
Church, and its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">[Pg 589]</a></span>
unity, and that after much reflection, in agreement
with the Privy Council and with the bishops: that as the Commons had the
same object in view, he was surprised that they were not content with
this announcement, and that they did not at all events state wherein the
King's declaration did not content them: for that the King was the
supreme governor of the English Church after God.</p>

<p>At this very time an order was issued to the Treasury, and to the
collectors of customs at the ports that tonnage and poundage should be
henceforth levied, just as it had been in the latter years of James I;
and that every one who refused payment should be punished.</p>

<p>In this way the King embarked afresh on a course of the most unequivocal
hostility towards his Parliament. But that body did not intend to give
way. It would not be deterred from drawing up a fresh remonstrance, in
which it made use of the strongest expressions to give point to its
claims. In this it was said, that whoever furthered Popery or
Arminianism, whoever collected or helped to collect tonnage and poundage
before it was granted, or who even paid it, the same was an enemy of the
English realm and of English liberty. This was a strange combination of
ecclesiastical and financial grievances and pretensions. But the course
of the transactions had established an intimate relation between them.
In regard to both the Commons again took up as hostile an attitude
towards the ministers of that day, as they had formerly taken up towards
the Duke of Buckingham. The Lord Treasurer Weston was the special object
of their hatred on both accounts. For it was said that he was a
rebellious Papist&mdash;nay even a Jesuit:&mdash;did not his nearest kinsmen
belong to that order?&mdash;and that he was now giving the King pernicious
advice, hostile to the rights of the country and the dignity of
Parliament. Proceeding on the principle that the collection of tonnage
and poundage was a breach of the constitution, preparations were made
for calling to account the officers engaged in this process. Nor would
men have been content to stop at the subordinates; they would have
reached even the highest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">[Pg 590]</a></span>
In this session the moderation which had been for some time exhibited in
the former dropped out of sight: the contempt shown to the Petition of
Right had called forth a spirit of bitter, violent, and unbounded
opposition. When the King, in order to prevent the formal passing of the
Remonstrance, proceeded in the first instance to have the session
adjourned, a scene of tumult and violence was witnessed, to which the
annals of former Parliaments offered no parallel.</p>

<p>The Speaker of the House, Sir John Finch, one of those men who had
passed over from the side of the Commons to that of the King, announced
to the assembled members after the opening of the sitting on the 2nd of
March, that the King adjourned the House till the 10th. But this was the
very hour when Sir John Eliot, who had drawn up the new Remonstrance had
with his friends intended to carry it through Parliament. The House
declared it illegal for the Speaker to make himself the mouthpiece of
the royal will: and when he tried to withdraw, he was held on his chair
by a couple of strong and resolute members. The Usher of the Black Rod,
whose business it was to declare the House adjourned, had already
appeared in the ante-room; but the doors of the hall were shut. In this
tumult the Remonstrance had to be read and voted on. The Speaker refused
to have anything to do with it, although it was declared 'to be his duty
to put it to the vote. Sir John Eliot and Denzil Holles must have
delivered the sense of the Remonstrance orally, rather than read it
properly through: but even in this fashion the majority of the House
made known their assent, and in this way the immediate object was
attained, as well as the circumstances allowed. On a threat that the
doors should be broken through, they were now opened, and the members
left the chamber.<a name="FNanchor_497_497" id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a></p>

<p>An extraordinary act of disobedience, considering that it was intended
to be the means of securing the legal forms of Parliament! It was the
last step in this stage of the proceedings. It involved an open breach
between the two authorities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">[Pg 591]</a></span>
In later times the responsibility for this act has been thrown on the
King. Contemporaries of moderate views, and who favoured the Parliament,
were of opinion however that the responsibility rather lay with those
fiery and crafty men who had possessed themselves of the control of
Parliament. For they thought that the King had seriously striven to
compose the quarrel: that people might well have accepted his first
declaration, and that the greater part of the members had been inclined
to do so; but that the seeming zeal of some few for the liberties of the
country had, unfortunately for England, prevented them from
yielding.<a name="FNanchor_498_498" id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a>
It is difficult to suppose that the strength and depth of
the opposition would any longer have permitted an adjustment. It was now
fully apparent at all events that the King and the Lower House could no
longer work together.</p>

<p>In the Privy Council the opinion was once more expressed, that
Parliament should be treated with indulgence. This was the wish of the
Lord Keeper Coventry: but the Treasurer recommended the strict
enforcement of the prerogative, and the King sided with this view. Not
only was the dissolution of Parliament pronounced, but just as Henry
VIII and Elizabeth had done, Charles I proceeded to punish the members
who had offended against his dignity in their speeches. He first of all
decided not to call Parliament together again. He declared that he had
now abundantly proved that he loved to rule by the help of Parliament;
that he had been compelled against his wish by the last proceedings to
desist from the attempt, and that he would not renew it until his people
had learnt to know him better. He said that he should consider it
presumption if any time were prescribed to him for reassembling
Parliament; that Parliament ought to be summoned, held, and dissolved,
solely at the discretion of the King.</p>

<p>The great advantage of Parliament in this conflict consisted in its
ability to appeal to legal precedents of past centuries in its favour.
What had once rendered the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">[Pg 592]</a></span>
continuance of the ascendancy of Parliament
impossible, the danger into which it had plunged the common interests of
the kingdom, was now forgotten. The laws of those times had not been
repealed, but had only been modified and curtailed in its own favour by
the sovereign power, which had grown strong since that time. Every
position, new or unusual at the moment, which Parliament maintained was,
if not laid down in former ordinances, yet at all events so logically
inferred from them, that it appeared customary and in accordance with
primitive law. If on the contrary Charles I maintained the prerogative
which his father had exercised, and which Queen Elizabeth and the House
of Tudor in general had possessed, he was placed in the awkward position
of appearing to act without the countenance of the laws. He now resolved
to govern, at least for a time, without the aid of Parliament. Many of
his ancestors had done exactly the same; but since their time attachment
to parliamentary government had become part of the national feeling. It
now appeared not only to represent fully the liberties, but also
especially the most popular religious tendencies of the country.</p>

<p>Whether under these circumstances the King would have succeeded in
giving effect to his ideas, even if more peaceful times had ensued, was
from the beginning extremely
doubtful.<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a></p>
